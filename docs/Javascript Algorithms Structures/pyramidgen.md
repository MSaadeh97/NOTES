# Building Pyarimid gen

## 1. Tags

- JavaScript is the programming language that powers the web. Unlike the HTML and CSS you have learned previously, JavaScript is most commonly used to write logic instead of markup.

- In this project, you will learn the basics of Javascript and apply those concepts to building a pyramid generator.

- A pyramid generator is a program where you can set the type of character, the count for the pyramid, and the direction of the pyramid. The program will then generate a pyramid based on those inputs.

- Click on the "Check your code" button to proceed to the next step and start the project.

- One of the most important concepts in programming is variables. A variable points to a specific memory address that stores a value. Variables are given a name which can be used throughout your code to access that value.

- Declaring a variable means giving it a name. In JavaScript, this is often done with the let keyword. For example, here is how you would declare a hello variable:

Example Code
let hello;
Variable naming follows specific rules: names can include letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores, but cannot contain spaces and must not begin with a number.

- Use the let keyword to declare a variable called character.

- Note: It is common practice to end statements in JavaScript with a semicolon. ;

```html
let character;
```

## 3

- Your character variable currently does not have a value. You can assign a value using the assignment operator =. For example:

Example Code
let hello = "Hello";
Assigning a value to a variable at the moment of its declaration is known as initialization.

Initialize your character variable by assigning it the value "Hello" during its declaration.

```html
let character = "Hello";
```

## 4

- JavaScript has seven primitive data types, with String being one of them. In JavaScript, a string represents a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (') or double (") quotes.

- Note that strings are immutable, which means once they are created, they cannot be changed. The variable can still be reassigned another value.

- Change your "Hello" string to use single quotes.

```html
let character = 'Hello';
```

## 5

- The console allows you to print and view JavaScript output. You can send information to the console using console.log(). For example, this code will print "Naomi" to the console:

Example Code
let developer = "Naomi";
console.log(developer);
The code above accesses the developer variable with its name in the console.log(). Note that the value between the parentheses is the value that will be printed.

- Print the value of the character variable to the console. Then, click the "Console" button to view the JavaScript console.

```html
let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);
```

## 6

- When a variable is declared with the let keyword, you can reassign (or change the value of) that variable later on. In this example, the value of programmer is changed from "Naomi" to "CamperChan".

Example Code
let programmer = "Naomi";
programmer = "CamperChan";
Note that when reassigning a variable, you do not use the let keyword again.

- After your console.log, assign the value "World" to your character variable.

```html
let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);
character = "World";
```

## 7

- Now log your character variable to the console again. You should see the string "Hello", then the string "World", in the console.

```html
let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);
character = "World";
console.log(character);
```

## 8

- When variable names are more than one word, there are specific naming conventions for how you capitalize the words. In JavaScript, the convention to use is camel case.

- Camel case means that the first word in the name is entirely lowercase, but the following words are all title-cased. Here are some examples of camel case:

Example Code
let variableOne;
let secondVariable;
let yetAnotherVariable;
let thisIsAnAbsurdlyLongName;
Use camel case to declare a new secondCharacter variable.

```html
let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);
character = "World";
console.log(character);
let secondCharacter;
```

## 9

- When you declare a variable without initializing it, it is considered uninitialized. Currently, your secondCharacter variable is uninitialized.

- Add a console.log() to see what the value of your secondCharacter variable is.

```html
let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);
character = "World";
let secondCharacter;
console.log(secondCharacter);
```

## 10

- The default value of an uninitialized variable is undefined. This is a special data type that represents a value that does not have a definition yet.

You can still assign a value to an uninitialized variable. Here is an example:

Example Code
let uninitialized;
uninitialized = "assigned";
Assign the string "Test" to your secondCharacter variable below your declaration. Open the console to see how your log has changed.

```html
let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);
character = "World";
let secondCharacter;
secondCharacter = "Test";
console.log(secondCharacter);
```

## 11

- You can also assign the value of a variable to another variable. For example:

Example Code
let first = "One";
let second = "Two";
second = first;
The second variable would now have the value "One".

To see this in action, change your secondCharacter assignment from "Test" to your character variable.

Then open the console to see what gets logged.

```html
secondCharacter = character;


```

## 12

- You are now ready to declare your next variable. Remove both console.log statements, and the character reassignment.

Also remove your secondCharacter variable, but leave the character initialization unchanged.

```html
let character = 'Hello';
```

## 13

- Before moving forward, you should take a moment to review the concepts you have learned.

Use the let keyword to declare a profession variable and an age variable. Initialize profession with the string "teacher", but do not initialize age with any value.

Log both of your variables to the console to see the results.

```html
let profession = "teacher";
console.log(profession);
let age;
console.log(age);
```

## 14

- Now that you have reviewed declaration and initialization, remove the code you wrote for your review.

Do not remove your character variable.

```html
```

## 15

- Use let to declare a count variable. Assign it the number 8. When using a number value, you do not use quotes. For example:

Example Code
let money = 100;

```html
Use let to declare a count variable. Assign it the number 8. When using a number value, you do not use quotes. For example:

Example Code
let money = 100;
```

## 16

- With the number data type, you can perform mathematical operations, like addition. Try printing count + 1 to the console.

```html
 let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
console.log(count + 1);
```

## 17

- You can also perform subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). Feel free to experiment with the operators and numbers in your console.log. When you are ready to move on, remove the console.log.

```html
let count = 8;

```

## 18

- In programming, you will often need to work with lots of data. There are many data structures that can help you organize and manage your data. One of the most basic data structures is an array.

An array is a non-primitive data type that can hold a series of values. Non-primitive data types differ from primitive data types in that they can hold more complex data. Primitive data types like strings and numbers can only hold one value at a time.

Arrays are denoted using square brackets ([]). Here is an example of a variable with the value of an empty array:

Example Code
let array = [];
Declare a rows variable and assign it an empty array.

```html
let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = [];
```

## 19

- When an array holds values, or elements, those values are separated by commas. Here is an array that holds two strings:

Example Code
let array = ["first", "second"];
Change your rows declaration to be an array with the strings "Naomi", "Quincy", and "CamperChan". The order of values in an array is important, so follow that order. Remember that strings are case-sensitive.

```html
let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
```

## 20

- You can access the values inside an array using the index of the value. An index is a number representing the position of the value in the array, starting from 0 for the first value.

You can access the value using bracket notation, such as array[0].

Use console.log and bracket notation to print the first value in your rows array.

```html
let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
console.log(rows[0]);
 ```

## 21

- Arrays are special in that they are considered mutable. This means you can change the value at an index directly.

For example, this code would assign the number 25 to the second element in the array:

Example Code
let array = [1, 2, 3];
array[1] = 25;
console.log(array); // prints [1, 25, 3]
Update the third element of your rows array to be the number 10. Then print the rows array to your console.

```html
rows[2] = 10;
console.log(rows);
 ```

## 22

- Notice how the value inside your rows array has been changed directly? This is called mutation. As you learn more about arrays, you will learn when to mutate an array, and when you should not.

Before moving on, this is a great opportunity to learn a common array use. Currently, your code accesses the last element in the array with rows[2]. But you may not know how many elements are in an array when you want the last one.

You can make use of the .length property of an array - this returns the number of elements in the array. To get the last element of any array, you can use the following syntax:

Example Code
array[array.length - 1]
array.length returns the number of elements in the array. By subtracting 1, you get the index of the last element in the array. You can apply this same concept to your rows array.

Update your rows[2] to dynamically access the last element in the rows array. Refer to the example above to help you.

You should not see anything change in your console.

```html
rows[rows.length - 1];

 ```

## 23

- For now, remove your first console log and your rows[rows.length - 1] assignment. Leave the second rows log statement for later.

```html

 ```

## 24

- In the last few steps, you learned all about working with arrays. Take a moment to review what you have learned.

Start by declaring a cities variable and initializing it as an array of the strings "London", "New York", and "Mumbai". Then log that variable to the console.

After logging, change the last element of cities to the string "Mexico City", then log the cities variable again.

When done correctly, you should see this output in the console.

Example Code
[ "London", "New York", "Mumbai" ]
[ "London", "New York", "Mexico City" ]

```html
let cities = ["London", "New York", "Mumbai"]
console.log(cities);
cities[2] = "Mexico City";
console.log(cities);
 ```

## 25

-Now you are ready to move onto the next set of array lessons.

Remove all of your code from the previous step.

```html

 ```

## 26

- A method in JavaScript is a function that's associated with certain values or objects. An example you've already encountered is the .log() method, which is part of the console object.

Arrays have their own methods, and the first you will explore is the .push() method. This allows you to "push" a value to the end of an array. Here is an example to add the number 12 to the end of an array:

Example Code
array.push(12);
Use .push() to add the string "freeCodeCamp" to the end of your rows array. Add this code before your console.log so you can see the change you made to your array.

```html
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
rows.push("freeCodeCamp");
console.log(rows);
 ```

## 27

- Another method essential for this project is the .pop() method. It removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

When a method returns a value, you can think of it as giving the value back to you, making it available for use in other parts of your code.

Create a new variable called popped and assign it the result of rows.pop(). Then, log popped to the console.

```html
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
rows.push("freeCodeCamp");
let popped = rows.pop();
console.log(popped);
console.log(rows);
 ```

## 28

- You should have seen "freeCodeCamp" printed to the console. This is because .pop() returns the value that was removed from the array - and you pushed "freeCodeCamp" to the end of the array earlier.

But what does .push() return? Assign your existing rows.push() to a new pushed variable, and log it.

```html
rows.push("freeCodeCamp");
let pushed = rows.push();
console.log(pushed);
```

## 29

- Were you expecting to see 4 in the console? .push() returns the new length of the array, after adding the value you give it.

It is important to be aware of what values a method returns. Take some time to experiment with .push() and .pop(). When you are ready, remove all of your .push() and .pop() calls, and your console.log statements.

```html

```

## 30

- Change your rows declaration to be assigned an empty array again.

Also, change your 'Hello' string to use double quotes again. Generally, it does not matter which of the two you prefer, but you will want to be consistent in that choice throughout your project.

```html
let character = "Hello";
let count = 8;
let rows = [];
```

## 31

- Declaring a variable with the let keyword allows it to be reassigned. This means you could change character later to be a completely different value.

For this project, you will not want to change these variable values. So instead, you should use const to declare them. const variables are special.

First, a const variable cannot be reassigned like a let variable. This code would throw an error:

Example Code
const firstName = "Naomi";
firstName = "Jessica";
A const variable also cannot be uninitialized. This code would throw an error:

Example Code
const firstName;
Replace your let keywords with const.

```html
const character = "Hello";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];
```

## 32

- You are now ready to start building your pyramid generator. Your character variable will serve as the building block for the pyramid.

"Hello" might not work very well for that. Change the value of character to be the hash character "#".

```html
const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];
```

## 33

- To generate a pyramid, you will need to create multiple rows. When you have to perform a task repeatedly until a condition is met, you will use a loop. There are many ways to write a loop.

You are going to start with a basic for loop. for loops use the following syntax:

Example Code
for (iterator; condition; iteration) {
  logic;
}
In the upcoming steps, you'll explore each component of a loop in detail. For now, construct a for loop that includes the terms "iterator", "condition", and "iteration" for the three components. Keep the loop body, the section within the curly braces {}, empty.

```html
for ("iterator"; "condition"; "iteration") {

}
```

## 34

- Your loop now needs a proper iterator. The iterator is a variable you can declare specifically in your for loop to control how the loop iterates or goes through your logic.

It is a common convention to use i as your iterator variable in a loop. A for loop allows you to declare this in the parentheses (). For example, here is a for loop that declares an index variable and assigns it the value 100.

Example Code
for (let index = 100; "second"; "third") {

}
Replace the string "iterator" with a let declaration for the variable i. Assign it the value 0 to start. This will give the i variable the value 0 the first time your loop runs.

```html
for (let i = 0; "condition"; "iteration") {

}
```

## 35

- The condition of a for loop tells the loop how many times it should iterate. When the condition becomes false, the loop will stop.

In JavaScript, a Boolean value can be either true or false. These are not strings - you will learn more about the difference later on.

For now, you will use the less than operator (<). This allows you to check if the value on the left is less than the value on the right. For example, count < 3 would evaluate to true if count is 2, and false if count is 4.

Replace your "condition" string with a condition to check if i is less than count.

```html
for (let i = 0; i < count; "iteration") {

}
```

## 36

- Your iteration statement will tell your loop what to do with the iterator after each run.

When you reassign a variable, you can use the variable to reference the previous value before the reassignment. This allows you to do things like add three to an existing number. For example, bees = bees + 3; would increase the value of bees by three.

Use that syntax to replace your "iteration" string with a reassignment statement that increases i by one.

```html
for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {

}
```

## 37

- Your loop should now run eight times. Inside the body of the loop, print the value of the i iterator and see what happens.

```html
for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
console.log(i);
}
```

## 38

- You should see the numbers zero through seven printed in your console, one per line. This will serve as the foundation for generating your pyramid.

Replace your log statement with a statement to push i to your rows array.

```html
for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(i);
}
```

## 39

- Unfortunately, now you cannot see what your loop is doing.

Use let to declare a result variable, and assign it an empty string. An empty string is represented by quotation marks with nothing between them, such as "".

```html
let result = "";
```

## 40

- Add a log statement to print the value of result. Depending on which console you use, you may not see anything printed.

```html
console.log(result);
```

## 41

- To manipulate the result string, you will use a different type of loop. Specifically, a for...of loop, which iterates over each item in an iterable object and temporarily assigns it to a variable.

The syntax for a for...of loop looks like:

Example Code
for (const value of iterable) {

}
Note that you can use const because the variable only exists for a single iteration, not during the entire loop.

Create a for...of loop to iterate through your rows array, assigning each value to a row variable.

```html
for (const row of rows) {

}
```

## 42

- Remember in your previous loop that you used the addition operator + to increase the value of i by 1.

You can do a similar thing with a string value, by appending a new string to an existing string. For example, hello = hello + " World"; would add the string " World" to the existing string stored in the hello variable. This is called concatenation.

In your for...of loop, use the addition operator to concatenate the row value to the result value.

```html
for (const row of rows) {
  result = result + row + " ";
}
```

## 43

- Now all of your numbers are appearing on the same line. This will not work for creating a pyramid.

You will need to add a new line to each row. However, pressing the return key to insert a line break between quotes in JavaScript will result in a parsing error. Instead, you need to use the special escape sequence \n, which is interpreted as a new line when the string is logged. For example:

Example Code
lineOne = lineOne + "\n" + lineTwo;
Use a second addition operator to concatenate a new line between the existing result value and the added row value.

```html
for (const row of rows) {
  result = result + "\n" + row;
}
```

## 44

- Printing numbers won't result in a visually appealing pyramid. Now that you're outputting the formatted content of your rows array, it's time to update your original loop.

Instead of pushing i to the array, push the value of your character variable.

```html
for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(character);
}
```

## 45

- Now you have a series of # characters, but the pyramid shape is still missing. Fortunately, the i variable represents the current "row" number in your loop, enabling you to use it for crafting a pyramid-like structure.

To achieve this, you will use the .repeat() method available to strings. This method accepts a number as an argument, specifying the number of times to repeat the target string. For example, using .repeat() to generate the string "Code! Code! Code!":

Example Code
const activity = "Code! ";
activity.repeat(3);
Use the .repeat() method on your character, and give it i for the number.

```html
for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(character);
  character.repeat(i);
}
```

## 46

- You're getting closer! At this point, you're encountering what's known as an off-by-one error, a frequent problem in zero-based indexing languages like JavaScript.

The first index of your rows array is 0, which is why you start your for loop with i = 0. But repeating a string zero times results in nothing to print.

To fix this, add 1 to the value of i in your .repeat() call. Do not assign it back to i like you did in your loop conditions.

```html
for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(character.repeat(i + 1))
}
```

## 47

- The logic for formatting this pyramid is likely going to get complicated, which means it's a great time to extract that code into a function.

A function is a block of code that can be reused throughout your application. Functions are declared with the following syntax:

Example Code
function name(parameter) {

}
The function keyword tells JavaScript that the name variable is going to be a function. parameter is a variable that represents a value that is passed into the function when it is used. A function may have as many, or as few, parameters as you'd like. Like a for loop, the space between the curly braces is the function body.

Declare a padRow function. Do not create any parameter variables yet. The function body should be empty. Remember that you need to use camel case for your naming convention.

```html
function padRow() {

}
```

## 48

- In order to use a function, you need to call it. A function call tells your application to run the code from the function wherever you choose to call it. The syntax for a function call is the function name followed by parentheses. For example, this code defines and calls a test function.

Example Code
function test() {

}
test();
Call your padRow function.

```html
function padRow() {

}
padRow();

```

## 49

- You are calling your padRow function, but not doing anything with that function call. All functions in JavaScript return a value, meaning they provide the defined result of calling them for you to use elsewhere.

To see the result of calling your padRow function, declare a call variable and assign your existing padRow call to that variable.

```html
padRow();
const call = padRow();

```

## 50

- Now add a log statement to print the value of your call variable.

```html
function padRow() {

}
const call = padRow();
console.log(call);
          
```

## 51

- Your call variable has an undefined value, even though you defined it! This is because your padRow function does not currently return a value. By default, functions return undefined as their value.

In order to return something else, you need to use the return keyword. Here is an example of a function that returns the string "Functions are cool!":

Example Code
function demo() {
  return "Functions are cool!";
}
Use the return keyword to have your function return the string "Hello!".

```html
function padRow() {
return "Hello!";
}
          
```

## 52

- When you have a value that is explicitly written in your code, like the "Hello!" string in your function, it is considered to be hard-coded. Hard-coding a value inside a function might not make it as reusable as you'd like.

Instead, you can define parameters for the function. Parameters are special variables that are given a value when you call the function, and can be used in your function to dynamically change the result of the function's code.

To add a parameter to your function, you need to add a variable name inside the parentheses. For example, this demo function has a name parameter:

Example Code
function demo(name) {

}
name sounds like a useful parameter, so go ahead and add it to your padRow function.

```html
function padRow(name) {
  return "Hello!";
}
          
```

## 53

- A function does not have to return a hard-coded value. It can return the value stored in a variable. Parameters are special variables for a function, so they can also be returned.

Change your padRow function to return the name parameter directly.

```html
function padRow(name) {
  return name;
}

```

## 54

- If you open your console again, you'll see that your padRow function is returning undefined, even though you defined a return value! This is because parameters need to be given a value when you call the function.

When you pass a value to a function call, that value is referred to as an argument. Here is an example of calling a demo function and passing "Naomi" as the argument for the name parameter.

Example Code
function demo(name) {
  return name;
}
demo("Naomi");
Pass your own name as the argument for the name parameter in your padRow call. Remember that your name is a string, so you'll need to use quotes.

```html
const call = padRow();
padRow("name");
```

## 55

- Before moving on, take a moment to review how functions work.

Declare a function named addTwoNumbers. This function should take two arguments and return the sum of those two arguments.

Your function should not use hard-coded values. An example of a hard-coded function might be:

Example Code
function sayName(firstName, lastName) {
  return "John Doe";
}

sayName("Camper", "Cat");
This function would return "John Doe" regardless of the arguments passed to the parameters firstName, and lastName, so "John Doe" is considered a hard-coded value.

Declare a sum variable and assign it the value of calling your addTwoNumbers function with 5 and 10 as the arguments. Log the sum variable to the console.

```html
const sum = addTwoNumbers(5,10);
function addTwoNumbers(a , b) {
return a + b;
}
console.log(sum);

```

## 56

- With that quick review complete, you should remove your addTwoNumbers function, sum variable, and log statement.

```html


```

## 57

- Variables in JavaScript are available in a specific scope. In other words, where a variable is declared determines where in your code it can be used.

The first scope is the global scope. Variables that are declared outside of any "block" like a function or for loop are in the global scope. Your character, count, and rows variables are all in the global scope.

When a variable is in the global scope, a function can access it in its definition. Here is an example of a function using a global title variable:

Example Code
const title = "Professor ";
function demo(name) {
  return title + name;
}
demo("Naomi")
This example would return "Professor Naomi". Update your padRow function to return the value of concatenating your character variable to the beginning of the name parameter.

```html
function padRow(name) {
  return character + name;
}
```

## 58

- Variables can also be declared inside a function. These variables are considered to be in the local scope, or block scope. A variable declared inside a function can only be used inside that function. If you try to access it outside of the function, you get a reference error.

To see this in action, use const to declare a test variable in your padRow function. Initialise it with the value "Testing".

Then, below your function, try to log test to the console. You will see an error because it is not defined outside of the function's local scope. Remove that console.log to pass the tests and continue.

```html
function padRow(name) {
  const test = "Testing";
  return character + name;
}

```

## 59

- Values returned out of a function are used by calling the function. You can use the function call directly as the value it returns, or capture the returned value in a variable. This way, you can use the value assigned to a locally scoped variable, outside the function it was created in.

Example Code
function getName() {
  const name = "Camper cat";
  return name;
}

console.log(getName()); // "Camper cat"

const capturedReturnValue = getName();
console.log(capturedReturnValue); // "Camper cat"

console.log(name); // reference error
To use your "Testing" value, return it out of the padRow function by updating your return statement to return only the test variable.

```html
function padRow(name) {
  const test = "Testing";  
  return test;
}
 ```

## 60

- Below the return statement, log the string "This works!" to the console.

After doing that, you will see that the string "This works!" does not display in the console, and the console.log("This works!") line is greyed out.

Copy the console log and paste it above the return statement. Now, the string "This works!" should appear in the console.

An important thing to know about the return keyword is that it does not just define a value to be returned from your function, it also stops the execution of your code inside a function or a block statement. This means any code after a return statement will not run.

```html
function padRow(name) {
  const test = "Testing";
  console.log("This works!");
  return test;
  console.log("This works!")
}
 ```

## 61

- Now your call variable has the value "Testing". But your function is no longer using the name parameter.

Remove the name parameter from your function declaration, then remove your "CamperChan" string from the padRow call.

Also, remove both console.log from the padRow function.

```html
function padRow() {
  const test = "Testing";
  return test;
}
const call = padRow();
console.log(call);
 ```

## 62

- Because your function was no longer using the parameter, changing the argument did not affect it.

Go ahead and remove the test declaration and return statement from your padRow function, so the function is empty again.

```html
function padRow() {

}
const call = padRow();
console.log(call);
 ```

## 63

- As expected, your function now returns undefined again. Your call variable is not necessary any more, so remove the call declaration and the console.log for the call variable.

```html
function padRow() {

}

 ```

## 64

- In order to know how to format a row, your padRow function will need to know which row number you are on, and how many rows in total are being generated.

The best way to do this is by creating function parameters for them. Give your padRow function a rowNumber and rowCount parameter. Multiple parameters are separated by a comma:

Example Code
function name(first, second) {

}

```html
function padRow(rowNumber, rowCount) {

}
```

## 65

- Remember in an earlier step, you learned about return values. A function can return a value for your application to consume separately.

In a function, the return keyword is used to specify a return value. For example, this function would return the value given to the first parameter:

Example Code
function name(parameter) {
  return parameter;
}
Use the return keyword to return the value of the character variable, repeated rowNumber times.

```html
function padRow(rowNumber, rowCount) {
  return character.repeat(rowNumber);
}
```

## 66

- A function call allows you to actually use a function. You may not have been aware of it, but the methods like .push() that you have been using have been function calls.

A function is called by referencing the function's name, and adding (). Here's how to call a test function:

Example Code
test();
Replace the character.repeat(i + 1) in your .push() call with a function call for your padRow function.

```html
for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(padRow());
}
```

## 67

- Your padRow function has two parameters which you defined. Values are provided to those parameters when a function is called.

The values you provide to a function call are referred to as arguments, and you pass arguments to a function call. Here's a function call with "Hello" passed as an argument:

Example Code
test("Hello");
Pass i + 1 and count as the arguments to your padRow call. Like parameters, arguments are separated by a comma.

```html
for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(padRow(i + 1, count))
}
```

## 69

- Now it is time for a bit of math. Consider a three-row pyramid. If we want it centered, it would look something like:

Example Code
··#··
·###·
Empty spaces have been replaced with interpuncts, or middle dots, for readability. If you extrapolate the pattern, you can see that the spaces at the beginning and end of a row follow a pattern.

Update your blank space strings to be repeated rowCount - rowNumber times.

Open up the console to see the result.

```html
function padRow(rowNumber, rowCount) {
  return " ".repeat(rowCount - rowNumber) + character.repeat(rowNumber) + " ".repeat(rowCount - rowNumber);
}
```

## 70

- You can pass full expressions as an argument. The function will receive the result of evaluating that expression. For example, these two function calls would yield the same result:

Example Code
test(2 * 3 + 1);
test(7);
Looking at the pattern again:

Example Code
··#··
·###·
Update the character value to be repeated 2 * rowNumber - 1 times.

Open up the console again to see the updated result.

```html
function padRow(rowNumber, rowCount) {
  return " ".repeat(rowCount - rowNumber) + character.repeat(2 * rowNumber - 1) + " ".repeat(rowCount - rowNumber);
}
```

## 71

- Your pyramid generator now functions as expected. But this is an excellent opportunity to further explore the code you have written.

The addition operator is not the only way to add values to a variable. The addition assignment operator can be used as shorthand to mean "take the original value of the variable, add this value, and assign the result back to the variable." For example, these two statements would yield the same result:

Example Code
test = test + 1;
test += 1;
Update your iterator statement in the for loop to use addition assignment.

```html
for (let i = 0; i < count; i += 1)
```

## 72

- Because you are only increasing i by 1, you can use the increment operator ++. This operator increases the value of a variable by 1, updating the assignment for that variable. For example, test would become 8 here:

Example Code
let test = 7;
test++;
Replace your addition assignment with the increment operator for your loop iteration.

```html
for (let i = 0; i < count; i++)
```

## 73

- Rather than having to pass i + 1 to your padRow call, you could instead start your loop at 1. This would allow you to create a one-indexed loop.

Update your iterator to start at 1 instead of 0.

```html
for (let i = 1; i < count; i++) {
  rows.push(padRow(i + 1, count));
}
```

## 74

- The pyramid looks a little funny now. Because you are starting the loop at 1 instead of 0, you do not need to add one to i when you pass it to padRow.

Update the first argument of your padRow call to be i.

```html
for (let i = 1; i < count; i++) {
  rows.push(padRow(i, count));
}
```

## 75

- Unfortunately, now the bottom of the pyramid has disappeared. This is because you have created another off-by-one error.

Your original loop went for i values from 0 to 7, because count is 8 and your condition requires i to be less than count. Your loop is now running for i values from 1 to 7.

Your loop needs to be updated to run when i is 8, too. Looking at your logic, this means your loop should run when i is less than or equal to count. You can use the less than or equal to operator <= for this.

Update your loop condition to run while i is less than or equal to count.

```html
for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
  rows.push(padRow(i, count));
}
```

## 76

- Comments can be helpful for explaining why your code takes a certain approach, or leaving to-do notes for your future self.

In JavaScript, you can use // to leave a single-line comment in your code.

Add a single-line comment above your function to remind yourself to change the code to a different kind of loop.

```html
//change code to different loop
for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
  rows.push(padRow(i, count));
}
```

## 77

- JavaScript also has support for multi-line comments. A multi-line comment starts with

Unlike a single-line comment, a multi-line comment will encapsulate multiple lines.

 <!-- Use /* and */ to turn your current for loop, including the body, into a multi-line comment. -->

```html
/* for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
  rows.push(padRow(i, count));
} */
```

## 78

- Your pyramid has disappeared again. That's okay - that is to be expected.

Before you create your new loop, you need to learn about if statements. An if statement allows you to run a block of code only when a condition is met. They use the following syntax:

Example Code
if (condition) {
  logic
}
Create an if statement with the boolean true as the condition. In the body, print the string "Condition is true".

```html
if (true) {
console.log("Condition is true")
}
```

## 79

- You'll see the string printed in the console, because true is in fact true.

Change the condition of your if statement to the boolean false.

```html
if (false) {
  console.log("Condition is true");
}
```

## 80

- Now the string is no longer printing, because false is not true. But what about other values?

Try changing the condition to the string "false".

```html
if ("false") {
  console.log("false");
}
```

## 81

- The text has appeared again! This is because "false" is a string, which when evaluated to a boolean becomes true. This means "false" is a truthy value.

A truthy value is a value that is considered true when evaluated as a boolean. Most of the values you encounter in JavaScript will be truthy.

A falsy value is the opposite - a value considered false when evaluated as a boolean. JavaScript has a defined list of falsy values. Some of them include false, 0, "", null, undefined, and NaN.

Try changing your if condition to an empty string "", which is a falsy value.

```html
if ("") {
  console.log("Condition is true");
}
```

## 82

- The text is gone again! Empty strings evaluate to false, making them a falsy value. You will learn more about truthy and falsy values in future projects.

In addition to if statements, JavaScript also has else if statements. else if statements allow you to check multiple conditions in a single block of code.

Here is the syntax for an else if statement:

Example Code
if (condition1) {
  // code to run if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // code to run if condition2 is true
} else if (condition3) {
  // code to run if condition3 is true
}
If the first condition is false, JavaScript will check the next condition in the chain. If the second condition is false, JavaScript will check the third condition, and so on.

Below your if statement, add an else if statement that checks if 5 is less than 10. Then inside the body of the else if statement, log the string "5 is less than 10" to the console.

Check the console to see the results.

```html
if ("") {
  console.log("Condition is true");
}
else if (5 < 10) {
console.log("5 is less than 10");
}
```

## 83

- Sometimes you will want to run different code when all of the if...else if conditions are false. You can do this by adding an else block.

An else block will only evaluate if the conditions in the if and else if blocks are not met.

Here the else block is added to the else if block.

Example Code

if (condition) {
  // this code will run if condition is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // this code will run if the first condition is false
} else {
  // this code will run
  // if the first and second conditions are false
}
Add an else block to the else if block. Inside the else block, log the string "This is the else block" to the console.

To see the results in the console, you can manually change the < in the else if statement to >. That will make the condition false and the else block will run.

```html
if ("") {
  console.log("Condition is true");
} else if (5 > 10) {
  console.log("5 is less than 10");
} else {
  console.log("This is the else block");
}
```

## 84

- Now that you have practiced working with if...else if...else statements, you can remove them from your code.

Once you complete that, use let to declare a continueLoop variable and assign it the boolean false. Then use let to declare a done variable and assign it the value 0.

```html
let continueLoop = false;
let done = 0;
```

## 85

- A while loop will run over and over again until the condition specified is no longer true. It has the following syntax:

Example Code
while (condition) {
  logic;
}
Use that syntax to declare a while loop with continueLoop as the condition. The body should be empty.

```html
 let continueLoop = false;
let done = 0;
while (continueLoop) {

}
```

## 86

- Right now, if you change continueLoop to true, your while loop will run forever. This is called an infinite loop, and you should be careful to avoid these. An infinite loop can lock up your system, requiring a full restart to escape.

To avoid this, start by using the increment operator to increase the value of the done variable inside your loop.

```html
while (continueLoop) {
done++;
}
```

## 87

- The equality operator == is used to check if two values are equal. To compare two values, you'd use a statement like value == 8.

Below done++ inside your loop, add an if statement. The statement should check if done is equal to count using the equality operator.

```html
while (continueLoop) {
  done++;
  if (done == count) {

  }
}
```

## 88

- The equality operator can lead to some strange behavior in JavaScript. For example, "0" == 0 is true, even though one is a string and one is a number.

The strict equality operator === is used to check if two values are equal and share the same type. As a general rule, this is the equality operator you should always use. With the strict equality operator, "0" === 0 becomes false, because while they might have the same value of zero, they are not of the same type.

Update your done == count condition to use the strict equality operator.

```html
if (done === count) {

  }
```

## 89

- When done has reached the value of count, we want the loop to stop executing.

Inside your if body, assign the boolean false to your continueLoop variable.

```html
if (done === count) {
    continueLoop = false;
  }
 ```

## 90

- To make your pyramid generate again, push the result of calling padRow with done and count as the arguments to your rows array, similar to what you did in your first loop.

```html
rows.push(padRow(done, count));

 ```

## 91

- The strict inequality operator !== allows you to check if two values are not equal, or do not have the same type. The syntax is similar to the equality operator: value !== 4.

Update your while loop condition to check if done is not equal to count.

```html
while (done !== count) {
  done++;
  rows.push(padRow(done, count));
  if (done === count) {
    continueLoop = false;
  } 
}
 ```

## 92

- Since you have moved the comparison into the while condition, you can remove your entire if statement.

```html
while (done !== count) {
  done++;
  rows.push(padRow(done, count));
}
 ```

## 93

- Your loop is no longer relying on the continueLoop variable. This makes the variable an unused declaration. Generally, you want to avoid unused declarations to prevent future confusion.

Remove your continueLoop variable.

```html
let done = 0;

while (done !== count) {
  done++;
  rows.push(padRow(done, count));
}
 ```

## 94

- Your pyramid generator is still working. However, it could be possible to end up with an infinite loop again.

Because you are only checking if done is not equal to count, if done were to be larger than count your loop would go on forever.

Update your loop's condition to check if done is less than or equal to count.

```html
let done = 0;

while (done <= count) {
  done++;
  rows.push(padRow(done, count));
}
 ```

## 95

- Using done to track the number of rows that have been generated is functional, but you can actually clean up the logic a bit further.

Arrays have a special length property that allows you to see how many values, or elements, are in the array. You would access this property using syntax like myArray.length.

Note that rows.length in the padRow call would give you an off-by-one error, because done is incremented before the call.

Update your condition to check if rows.length is less than count.

```html
let done = 0;

while (rows.length < count) {
  done++;
  rows.push(padRow(done, count));
}
 ```

## 96

- Replace the done reference in your padRow call with rows.length + 1.

```html
let done = 0;

while (rows.length < count) {
  done++;
  rows.push(padRow(rows.length + 1, count));
}
 ```

## 97

- Now you no longer need your done variable. Remove the increment operation from your loop, and the variable declaration for done.

```html
while (rows.length < count) {
  rows.push(padRow(rows.length + 1, count));
}
```

## 98

- That's a very clean and functional loop. Nice work! But there's still more to explore.

Use a multi-line comment to comment out your while loop.

```html
That's a very clean and functional loop. Nice work! But there's still more to explore.

Use a multi-line comment to comment out your while loop.
```

## 99

- What if you made your pyramid upside-down, or inverted? Time to try it out!

Start by creating a new for loop. Declare your iterator i and assign it the value of count, then use the boolean false for your condition and iteration statements.

```html
for (let i = count; false; false) {

}
```

## 100

- Because you are going to loop in the opposite direction, your loop needs to run while i is greater than 0. You can use the greater than operator > for this.

Set your loop's condition to run when i is greater than 0.

```html
for (let i = count; i > 0; false) {

}
```

## 101

- Your iteration statement is also going to be different. Instead of adding 1 to i with each loop, you need to subtract 1.

Like you did earlier with i = i + 1, update your iteration statement to give i the value of subtracting 1 from itself.

```html
for (let i = count; i > 0; i = i - 1) {

}
```

## 102

- Again, push the result of calling padRow with your i and count variables to your rows array.

Open up the console to see the upside-down pyramid.

```html
for (let i = count; i > 0; i = i - 1) {
  rows.push(padRow(i, count));
}
```

## 103

- Just like addition, there are different operators you can use for subtraction. The subtraction assignment operator -= subtracts the given value from the current variable value, then assigns the result back to the variable.

Replace your iterator statement with the correct statement using the subtraction assignment operator.

```html
for (let i = count; i > 0; i -= 1) {
  rows.push(padRow(i, count));
}
```

## 104

- Because you are only subtracting one from i, you can use the decrement operator --.

Replace your subtraction assignment with the decrement operator.

```html
for (let i = count; i > 0; i--) {
  rows.push(padRow(i, count));
}
```

## 105

- Use a multi-line comment to comment out this loop as well, to prepare for the next approach.

```html
/* for (let i = count; i > 0; i--) {
  rows.push(padRow(i, count));
} */
```

## 106

- You can actually build the inverted pyramid without needing to loop "backwards" like you did.

To do this, you'll need to learn a couple of new array methods. Start by using const to declare a numbers variable. Assign it an array with the elements 1, 2, and 3. Then log the numbers array.

```html
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(numbers);
```

## 107

- The .unshift() method of an array allows you to add a value to the beginning of the array, unlike .push() which adds the value at the end of the array. .unshift() returns the new length of the array it was called on.

Example Code
const countDown = [2, 1, 0];
const newLength = countDown.unshift(3);
console.log(countDown); // [3, 2, 1, 0]
console.log(newLength); // 4
Use const to declare an unshifted variable, and assign it the result of calling .unshift() on your numbers array. Pass 5 as the argument. Then print your unshifted variable.

```html
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const unshifted = numbers.unshift(5)
console.log(unshifted);
```

## 108

- Arrays also have a .shift() method. This will remove the first element of the array, unlike .pop() which removes the last element. Here is an example of the .shift() method:

Example Code
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.shift();
The numbers array would be [2, 3].

Directly below your numbers array, declare a shifted variable and assign it the result of calling .shift() on the numbers array. On the next line, log the shifted variable to the console.

```html
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const shifted = numbers.shift();
console.log(shifted);
const unshifted = numbers.unshift(5);
console.log(unshifted);
console.log(numbers);
```

## 109

- Now that you've tried these methods, you can do another inverted pyramid approach. But first you need to clean up your experimentation.

Remove your numbers array, and the method calls and log calls.

```html
```

## 110

- Sometimes you may wish to bring back previous code that you commented out. You can do so by removing the around that code. This is called uncommenting.

Uncomment only your first for loop. Leave the single line comment and the other two multi line comments in place.

```html
// TODO: use a different type of loop
for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
  rows.push(padRow(i, count));
}

/*while (rows.length < count) {
  rows.push(padRow(rows.length + 1, count));
}*/

/*for (let i = count; i > 0; i--) {
  rows.push(padRow(i, count));
}*/
```

## 111

- Your pyramid is no longer inverted. This is because you are adding new rows to the end of the array.

Update your loop body to add new rows to the beginning of the array.

```html
for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
  rows.unshift(padRow(i, count));
}
```

## 112

- What if you had a way to toggle between an inverted pyramid and a standard pyramid?

Start by declaring an inverted variable, and assigning it the value true. You are not changing this variable in your code, but you will need to use let so our tests can modify it later.

```html
let inverted = true;
```

## 113

- Use an if statement to check if inverted is true. Remember that you do not need to use an equality operator here.

```html
for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
  if (inverted) {

  }
  rows.unshift(padRow(i, count));
}
```

## 114

- Now move your .unshift() call into your if block.

```html
for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
  if (inverted) {
    rows.unshift(padRow(i, count));
  }
}
```

## 115

- If your pyramid is not inverted, then you will want to have an else block that builds the pyramid in the normal order.

In earlier steps, you learned how to work with else statement like this:

Example Code
if (condition) {
  // if condition is true, run this code
} else {
  // if condition is false, run this code
}
Add an else block to your if block.

```html
for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
  if (inverted) {
    rows.unshift(padRow(i, count));
  } else {
    
  }

}
```

## 116

- When inverted is false, you want to build a standard pyramid. Use .push() like you have in previous steps to achieve this.

```html
for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
  if (inverted) {
    rows.unshift(padRow(i, count));
  } else {
    rows.push(padRow(i, count));
  }
}
```

## 117

- Your pyramid generator is now in a finished state, with more functionality than you originally planned! The next step is to clean up your code.

Remove all comments, both single- and multi-line, from your code.

```html

for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
  if (inverted) {
    rows.unshift(padRow(i, count));
  } else {
    rows.push(padRow(i, count));
  }
}
```

## 118

- Nice work! Experiment with different values for your character, count, and inverted variables.

When you are ready to move on to your next project, set character to "!", count to 10, and inverted to false to continue.

Congratulations on completing your first JavaScript project!

```html
const character = "!";
const count = 10;
const rows = [];
let inverted = false;
```
