# Building role playing game

## 1. Tags

- JavaScript is a powerful language which allows you to build websites that are interactive.

Note: For all remaining projects in this curriculum, you will need a basic level of knowledge in HTML and CSS. If you are new to HTML and CSS, please go through the Responsive Web Design Certification.

To get started, create your standard HTML boilerplate with a DOCTYPE, html, head, and body, then add a meta tag for the charset. Add a title element and use the text RPG - Dragon Repeller for it. Include a link tag for your stylesheet to link the styles.css file.

Finally, create a div element with id set to game within your body.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>RPG - Dragon Repeller</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="game"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

## 2

- Now you can start writing your JavaScript. Begin by creating a script element. This element is used to load JavaScript into your HTML file.

Example Code
  // JavaScript code goes here
</script>

```html
<script>

  </script>
```

## 3

- One of the most powerful tools is your developer console. Depending on your browser, this might be opened by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I. On Mac, you can press Option + âŒ˜ + C and select "Console". You can also click the "Console" button above the preview window to see our built-in console.

The developer console will include errors that are produced by your code, but you can also use it to see values of variables in your code, which is helpful for debugging.

Add a console.log("Hello World"); line between your script tags. Then click the "Console" button to open the console. You should see the text "Hello World".

```html
<script>
      console.log("Hello World");
    </script>
```

## 4

- Before you start writing your project code, you should move it to its own file to keep things organized.

Remove your console.log("Hello World"); line. Then give your now empty script element a src attribute set to ./script.js.

```html
<script src="./script.js">
      
    </script>
```

## 5

- Your view has been switched to your new script.js file. Remember that you can use the tabs above to switch between files.

Add your console.log("Hello World"); line to this file, and see it appear in your console.

```html
console.log("Hello World");
```

## 6

- Remove your console.log("Hello World"); line to begin writing your project code.

In the previous project, you learned how to work with variables and the let keyword like this:

Example Code
let camperbot;
You also learned how to initialize a variable with a value like this:

Example Code
let age = 32;
Use the let keyword to declare a variable called xp and assign it the value of 0, a number.

```html
let xp = 0;
```

## 7

- Initialize another variable called health with a value of 100, and a variable called gold with a value of 50.

```html
let xp = 0;
let health = 100;
let gold = 50;
```

## 8

- Create another variable called currentWeaponIndex and set it to 0.

```html
let xp = 0;
let health = 100;
let gold = 50;
let currentWeaponIndex = 0;
```

## 9

- Declare a variable called fighting but do not initialize it with a value.

```html
let xp = 0;
let health = 100;
let gold = 50;
let currentWeaponIndex = 0;
let fighting;
```

## 10

- Declare two more variables named monsterHealth and inventory.

For your inventory variable, assign it the value of an array containing the string "stick".

Remember that you worked with arrays in the previous project like this:

Example Code
let exampleArray = ["first", "second", "third"];

```html
let xp = 0;
let health = 100;
let gold = 50;
let currentWeaponIndex = 0;
let fighting;
let monsterHealth;
let inventory = ["stick"];
```

## 11

- In your role playing game, users will be able to track their stats, buy weapons, and fight monsters. Before you can continue with the interactive JavaScript portion of the game, you need to first create the HTML elements that will display the game information.

Create four div elements within your #game element. Give them the following respective id values, in order: stats, controls, monsterStats, and text.

```html
<body>
    <div id="game">
      <div id="stats"></div>
      <div id="controls"></div>
      <div id="monsterStats"></div>
      <div id="text"></div>
    </div>
  </body>
```

## 12

- Create three span elements within your #stats element. Give each of them the class stat. Then give the first one the text XP: 0, the second one the text Health: 100, and the third one the text Gold: 50.

```html
<body>
    <div id="game">
      <div id="stats">
        <span class="stat">XP: 0</span>
        <span class="stat">Health: 100</span>
        <span class="stat">Gold: 50</span>
      </div>
      <div id="controls"></div>
      <div id="monsterStats"></div>
      <div id="text"></div>
    </div>
  </body>
```

## 13

- Wrap the numbers 0, 100, and 50 in span elements, and wrap those new span elements in strong elements. Then give your new span elements id values of xpText, healthText, and goldText, respectively.

Your answer should follow this basic structure:

Example Code

```html
<span class="stat">XP: <strong><span id="xpText">0</span></strong></span>
        <span class="stat">Health: <strong><span id="healthText">100</strong></span></span>
        <span class="stat">Gold: <strong><span id="goldText">50</strong></span></span>
```

## 14

- For your #controls element, create three button elements. The first should have the id set to button1, and the text Go to store. The second should have the id set to button2, and the text Go to cave. The third should have the id set to button3, and the text Fight dragon.

```html
<div id="controls">
        <button id="button1">Go to store</button>
        <button id="button2">Go to cave</button>
        <button id="button3">Fight dragon</button>
      </div>
```

## 15

- JavaScript interacts with the HTML using the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM is a tree of objects that represents the HTML. You can access the HTML using the document object, which represents your entire HTML document.

One method for finding specific elements in your HTML is using the querySelector() method. The querySelector() method takes a CSS selector as an argument and returns the first element that matches that selector. For example, to find the element in your HTML, you would write:

Example Code
let h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
Note that h1 is a string and matches the CSS selector you would use.

Create a button1 variable and use querySelector() to assign it your element with the id of button1. Remember that CSS id selectors are prefixed with a #.

```html
let button1 = document.querySelector("#button1");
```

## 16

- We have run into a slight problem. You are trying to query your page for a button element, but your script tag is in the head of your HTML. This means your code runs before the browser has finished reading the HTML, and your document.querySelector() will not see the button - because the browser hasn't processed it yet.

To fix this, move your script element out of the head element, and place it at the end of your body element (just before the closing </body> tag.)

```html
 <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
    <title>RPG - Dragon Repeller</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="game">
      <div id="stats">
        <span class="stat">XP: <strong><span id="xpText">0</span></strong></span>
        <span class="stat">Health: <strong><span id="healthText">100</span></strong></span>
        <span class="stat">Gold: <strong><span id="goldText">50</span></strong></span>
      </div>
      <div id="controls">
        <button id="button1">Go to store</button>
        <button id="button2">Go to cave</button>
        <button id="button3">Fight dragon</button>
      </div>
      <div id="monsterStats"></div>
      <div id="text"></div>
    </div>
    <script src="./script.js"></script>
  </body>
```

## 17

- button1 is a variable that is not going to be reassigned. If you are not going to assign a new value to a variable, it is best practice to use the const keyword to declare it instead of the let keyword. This will tell JavaScript to throw an error if you accidentally reassign it.

Change your button1 variable to be declared with the const keyword.

```html
const button1 = document.querySelector("#button1");
```

## 18

- Use querySelector() to get the other two button elements using their ids: button2 and button3. Store them in variables called button2 and button3. Remember to use const.

```html
const button1 = document.querySelector("#button1");
const button2 = document.querySelector("#button2");
const button3 = document.querySelector("#button3");
```

## 19

- Similar to your #stats element, your #monsterStats element needs two span elements. Give them the class stat and give the first element the text Monster Name:  and the second the text Health: . After the text in each, add a strong element with an empty nested span element. Give the first inner span element an id of monsterName and the second inner span element an id of monsterHealth.

```html
<div id="monsterStats">
         <span class="stat">Monster Name: <strong><span id="monsterName"></span></strong></span>
            <span class="stat">Health: <strong><span id="monsterHealth"></span></strong></span>
      </div>
```

## 20

- Give your #text element the following text:

Example Code
Welcome to Dragon Repeller. You must defeat the dragon that is preventing people from leaving the town. You are in the town square. Where do you want to go? Use the buttons above.

```html
<div id="text">
        <p>Welcome to Dragon Repeller. You must defeat the dragon that is preventing people from leaving the town. You are in the town square. Where do you want to go? Use the buttons above.</p>
      </div>
 ```

## 21

- Now we need some quick styling. Start by giving the body a background-color set to #0a0a23.

```html
body {
  background-color: #0a0a23;
}
 ```

## 22

- Give the #text element a background-color of #0a0a23, a color of #ffffff, and 10px of padding on all sides.

```html
#text {
  background-color: #0a0a23;
  color: #ffffff;
  padding: 10px;
}
 ```

## 23

- Give your #game a maximum width of 500px and a maximum height of 400px. Set the background-color to #ffffff and the color to #ffffff.

Use margins to center it by setting the top margin to 30px, bottom margin to 0px, and the left and right margin to auto.

Finally, give it 10px of padding on all four sides.

```html
#game {
  max-width: 500px;
  max-height: 400px;
  background-color: #ffffff;
  color: #ffffff;
  margin-top: 30px;
  margin-bottom: 0px;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  padding: 10px;
}
 ```

## 24

- Using a selector list (selector1, selector2) give both your #controls and #stats elements a border of 1px solid #0a0a23, a #0a0a23 text color, and 5px of padding.

```html
#controls, #stats {
  border: 1px solid #0a0a23;
  padding: 5px;
  color: #0a0a23;
}
 ```

## 25

- Give your #monsterStats element the same border and padding as your #stats element. Set its color to #ffffff and give it a #c70d0d background.

```html
#monsterStats {
  border: 1px solid #0a0a23;
  background-color: #c70d0d;
  padding: 5px;
  color: #ffffff;
}
 ```

## 26

- For now, hide your #monsterStats element with the display property. Do not change any of the other styling.

```html
#monsterStats {
  display: none;
  border: 1px solid #0a0a23;
  padding: 5px;
  color: #ffffff;
  background-color: #c70d0d;
}
 ```

## 27

- Next, give your .stat elements a padding-right of 10px.

```html
.stat {
  padding-right: 10px;
}
 ```

## 28

- Finally, you will need to add some styles for your buttons. Start by setting the cursor property to pointer. Then set the text color to #0a0a23 and the background-color to #feac32.

Then set the background-image property to linear-gradient(#fecc4c, #ffac33). Lastly, set the border to 3px solid #feac32.

```html
button {
  cursor: pointer;
  color: #0a0a23;
  background-color: #feac32;
  background-image: linear-gradient(#fecc4c, #ffac33);
  border: 3px solid #feac32;
}
```

## 29

- Just like you did with the buttons, create variables for the following ids and use querySelector() to give them the element as a value:

text, xpText, healthText, goldText, monsterStats, and monsterName.

Remember to declare these with the const keyword, and name the variables to match the ids.

```html
const button1 = document.querySelector("#button1");
const button2 = document.querySelector("#button2");
const button3 = document.querySelector("#button3");
const text = document.querySelector("#text");
const xpText = document.querySelector("#xpText");
const healthText = document.querySelector("#healthText");
const goldText = document.querySelector("#goldText");
const monsterStats = document.querySelector("#monsterStats");
const monsterName = document.querySelector("#monsterName");
```

## 30

- Finally, use querySelector() to get the #monsterHealth element. Because you have already declared a monsterHealth variable earlier, you need to use a different variable name for this element.

Declare a new variable with the const keyword and name it monsterHealthText.

```html
const button1 = document.querySelector("#button1");
const button2 = document.querySelector("#button2");
const button3 = document.querySelector("#button3");
const text = document.querySelector("#text");
const xpText = document.querySelector("#xpText");
const healthText = document.querySelector("#healthText");
const goldText = document.querySelector("#goldText");
const monsterStats = document.querySelector("#monsterStats");
const monsterName = document.querySelector("#monsterName");
const monsterHealthText = document.querySelector("#monsterHealth");
```

## 31

- In the previous project, you learned how to create a function like this:

Example Code
function functionName() {

}
Create an empty function named goStore.

```html
function goStore() {

}
```

## 32

- For now, make your goStore function output the message "Going to store." to the console.

```html
function goStore() {
  console.log("Going to store.");
}
```

## 33

- Now create a goCave function that prints "Going to cave." to the console.

```html
"Going to cave.
```

## 34

- Now create a fightDragon function that prints "Fighting dragon." to the console.

```html
function fightDragon() {
  console.log("Fighting dragon.");
}
```

## 35

- In the previous project, you learned how to work with single line and multi-line comments like this:

Example Code
// I am a single-line comment

/*
  I am a multi-line comment
*/
Add a single-line comment that says initialize buttons.

```html
// initialize buttons
```

## 36

- button1 represents your first button element. These elements have a special property called onclick, which you can use to determine what happens when someone clicks that button.

You can access properties in JavaScript a couple of different ways. The first is with dot notation. Here is an example of using dot notation to set the onclick property of a button to a function reference.

Example Code
button.onclick = myFunction;
In this example, button is the button element, and myFunction is a reference to a function. When the button is clicked, myFunction will be called.

Use dot notation to set the onclick property of your button1 to the function reference of goStore. Note that button1 is already declared, so you don't need to use let or const.

```html
button1.onclick = goStore;
```

## 37

- Using the same syntax, set the onclick properties of button2 and button3 to goCave and fightDragon respectively.

Once you have done that, open your console and try clicking the buttons on your project.

```html
// initialize buttons
button1.onclick = goStore;
button2.onclick = goCave;
button3.onclick = fightDragon;
```

## 38

- The innerText property controls the text that appears in an HTML element. For example:

Example Code
The following example would change the text of the p element from Demo content to Hello World.

When a player clicks your Go to store button, you want to change the buttons and text. Remove the code inside the goStore function and add a line that updates the text of button1 to say "Buy 10 health (10 gold)".

```html
function goStore() {
  button1.innerText = "Buy 10 health (10 gold)";
}
```

## 39

- Now, add a line that updates the text of button2 to say "Buy weapon (30 gold)" and update the text of button3 to say "Go to town square".

```html
function goStore() {
  button1.innerText = "Buy 10 health (10 gold)";
  button2.innerText = "Buy weapon (30 gold)";
  button3.innerText = "Go to town square";
}
```

## 40

- You will also need to update the functions that run when the buttons are clicked again.

In your goStore() function, update the onclick property for each button to run buyHealth, buyWeapon, and goTown, respectively.

```html
console.log(result);
```

## 41

- Now you need to modify your display text. Change the innerText property of the text variable to be "You enter the store.".

```html
function goStore() {
  button1.innerText = "Buy 10 health (10 gold)";
  button2.innerText = "Buy weapon (30 gold)";
  button3.innerText = "Go to town square";
  button1.onclick = buyHealth;
  button2.onclick = buyWeapon;
  button3.onclick = goTown;
  text.innerText = "You enter the store.";
}
```

## 42

- Create three new empty functions called buyHealth, buyWeapon, and goTown.

```html
function buyHealth() {

}

function buyWeapon() {
  
}

function goTown() {
  
}
```

## 43

- Move your goTown function above your goStore function. Then copy and paste the contents of the goStore function into the goTown function.

```html
function goTown() {
button1.innerText = "Buy 10 health (10 gold)";
  button2.innerText = "Buy weapon (30 gold)";
  button3.innerText = "Go to town square";
  button1.onclick = buyHealth;
  button2.onclick = buyWeapon;
  button3.onclick = goTown;
  text.innerText = "You enter the store.";
}

function goStore() {
  button1.innerText = "Buy 10 health (10 gold)";
  button2.innerText = "Buy weapon (30 gold)";
  button3.innerText = "Go to town square";
  button1.onclick = buyHealth;
  button2.onclick = buyWeapon;
  button3.onclick = goTown;
  text.innerText = "You enter the store.";
}

function goCave() {
  console.log("Going to cave.");
}

function fightDragon() {
  console.log("Fighting dragon.");
}

function buyHealth() {

}

function buyWeapon() {

}
```

## 44

- In your goTown function, change your button elements' innerText properties to be "Go to store", "Go to cave", and "Fight dragon". Update your onclick properties to be goStore, goCave, and fightDragon, respectively.

Finally, update innerText property of your text to be "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says Store.".

```html
function goTown() {
  button1.innerText = "Go to store";
  button2.innerText = "Go to cave";
  button3.innerText = "Fight dragon";
  button1.onclick = goStore;
  button2.onclick = goCave;
  button3.onclick = fightDragon;
  text.innerText = "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says Store.";
}
```

## 45

- You need to wrap the text Store in double quotes. Because your string is already wrapped in double quotes, you'll need to escape the quotes around Store. You can escape them with a backslash \. Here is an example:

Example Code
const escapedString = "Naomi likes to play \"Zelda\" sometimes.";
Wrap the text Store in double quotes within your text.innerText line.

```html
function goTown() {
  button1.innerText = "Go to store";
  button2.innerText = "Go to cave";
  button3.innerText = "Fight dragon";
  button1.onclick = goStore;
  button2.onclick = goCave;
  button3.onclick = fightDragon;
  text.innerText = "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store\".";
}
```

## 46

- You have repetition in the goTown and goStore functions. Repetition in your code is a sign that you need another function.

In the previous project, you learned how to work with function parameters like this:

Example Code
function myFunction(param) {
  console.log(param);
}
Function parameters act as placeholders for values that you pass to the function when you call it.

Create an empty update function that takes a parameter called location.

```html
function update(location) {

}
```

## 47

- In your role playing game, you will be able to visit different locations like the store, the cave, and the town square. You will need to create a data structure that will hold the different locations.

Use const to create a variable called locations and assign it an empty array.

```html
const locations = [];
```

## 48

- Before you can begin to build out your locations array, you will first need to learn about objects. Objects are an important data type in JavaScript. The next few steps will be dedicated to learning about them so you will better understand how to apply them in your project.

Objects are non primitive data types that store key-value pairs. Non primitive data types are mutable data types that are not undefined, null, boolean, number, string, or symbol. Mutable means that the data can be changed after it is created.

Here is the basic syntax for an object:

Example Code
{
  key: value
}
You will learn about keys and values in the next few steps.

For now, create a const variable called cat and assign it an empty object {}.

Below that cat variable, add a console.log(cat) statement to see the object in the console.

```html
const cat = {}; 
console.log(cat);
```

## 49

- Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through properties.

Properties consist of a key and a value. The key is the name of the property, and the value is the data stored in the property.

Here is an example of an object with a single property:

Example Code
const obj = {
  name: "Quincy Larson"
};
Inside your cat object, add a new property. The key should be name and the value should be the string "Whiskers".

Open up the console to see the updates to your object.

```html
const cat = {
  name: "Whiskers"
};
```

## 50

- If the property name (key) of an object has a space in it, you will need to use single or double quotes around the name.

Here is an example of an object with a property name that has a space:

Example Code
const spaceObj = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
};
If you tried to write a key without the quotes, it would throw an error:

Example Code
const spaceObj = {
  // Throws an error
  Space Name: "Kirk",
};

Add a new property with a key of "Number of legs" and value of 4 to the cat object.

Open up the console to see the output.

```html
const cat = {
  name: "Whiskers",
  "Number of legs": 4
};
```

## 51

- There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

Example Code
object.property;
Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read the name property of the developer object:

Example Code
const developer = {
  name: "Jessica",
}

// Output: Jessica
console.log(developer.name);
Update your console statement to access the name property of the cat object using dot notation.

Open up the console to see the name of "Whiskers" logged to the console.

```html
console.log(cat.name)
          
```

## 52

- The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.

Example Code
objectName["property name"];
Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property:

Example Code
const spaceObj = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
};

spaceObj["Space Name"]; // "Kirk"
Update your console statement to use bracket notation to access the property "Number of legs" of the cat object.

Open up the console to see the output.

```html
console.log(cat["Number of legs"]);  
```

## 53

- Later on in the curriculum, you will dive deeper into objects. But for now, it is time to apply what you have learned to your role playing game.

Start by deleting your cat object and console statement.

```html

```

## 54

- Your locations array will hold different locations like the store, the cave, and the town square. Each location will be represented as an object.

Inside your locations array, add an object. Inside that object add a key called name with a value of "town square".

Remember to follow this syntax:

Example Code
{
  key: value
}

```html
const locations = [
  {
        name: "town square"
    }
];
```

## 55

- Just like array values, object properties are separated by a comma. Add a comma after your name property and add a button text property with the value of an empty array.

Since the property name has a space in it, you will need to surround it with quotes.

Example Code
{
  name: "Naomi",
  "favorite color": "purple"
}

```html
const locations = [
  {
    name: "town square",
    "button text": []
  }
];
```

## 56

- Give your empty button text array three string elements. Use the three strings being assigned to the button innerText properties in the goTown function. Remember that array values are separated by commas.

```html
const locations = [
  {
    name: "town square",
    "button text": [button1.innerText = "Go to store", button1.innerText = "Go to cave", button1.innerText = "Fight dragon"]
  }
];
```

## 57

- Create another property in your object called button functions. Give this property an array containing the three functions assigned to the onclick properties in the goTown function. Remember that these functions are variables, not strings, and should not be wrapped in quotes.

```html
const locations = [
  {
    name: "town square",
    "button text": ["Go to store", "Go to cave", "Fight dragon"],
    "button functions": [goStore, goCave, fightDragon]
  }
];
```

## 58

- Add one final property to the object named text. Give this property the same string value as the one assigned to text.innerText in the goTown function.

```html
const locations = [
  {
    name: "town square",
    "button text": ["Go to store", "Go to cave", "Fight dragon"],
    "button functions": [goStore, goCave, fightDragon],
    text: "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store\"."
  }
];

```

## 59

- Add a second object to your locations array (remember to separate them with a comma). Following the pattern you used in the first object, create the same properties but use the values from the goStore function. Set the name property to store.

```html
const locations = [
  {
    name: "town square",
    "button text": ["Go to store", "Go to cave", "Fight dragon"],
    "button functions": [goStore, goCave, fightDragon],
    text: "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store\"."
  },
  {
    name: "store",
    "button text": ["Buy 10 health (10 gold)", "Buy weapon (30 gold)", "Go to town square"],
    "button functions": [buyHealth, buyWeapon, goTown],
    text: "You enter the store."
  }
];
 ```

## 60

- Now you can consolidate some of your code. Start by copying the code from inside the goTown function and paste it into your update function. Then, remove all the code from inside the goTown and goStore functions.

```html
function update(location) {
  button1.innerText = "Go to store";
  button2.innerText = "Go to cave";
  button3.innerText = "Fight dragon";
  button1.onclick = goStore;
  button2.onclick = goCave;
  button3.onclick = fightDragon;
  text.innerText = "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store\".";
  button1.innerText = "Buy 10 health (10 gold)";
  button2.innerText = "Buy weapon (30 gold)";
  button3.innerText = "Go to town square";
  button1.onclick = buyHealth;
  button2.onclick = buyWeapon;
  button3.onclick = goTown;
  text.innerText = "You enter the store.";
}

function goTown() {
  
}

function goStore() {
  
}
 ```

## 61

- Instead of assigning the innerText and onclick properties to specific strings and functions, the update function will use data from the location that is passed into it. First, that data needs to be passed.

Inside the goTown function, call the update function. Here is an example of calling a function named myFunction:

Example Code
myFunction();

```html
function goTown() {
  update();
}
 ```

## 62

- Now it is time to use your update function. Pass in your locations array into the update function call.

You pass arguments by including them within the parentheses of the function call. For example, calling myFunction with an arg argument would look like:

Example Code
myFunction(arg)
Pass your locations array into the update call.

```html
function goTown() {
  update(locations);
}
 ```

## 63

- The locations array contains two locations: the "town square" and the "store". Currently you are passing that entire array into the update function.

Pass in only the first element of the locations array by adding [0] at the end of the variable. For example: myFunction(arg[0]);.

This is called bracket notation. Values in an array are accessed by index. Indices are numerical values and start at 0 - this is called zero-based indexing. arg[0] would be the first element in the arg array.

```html
function goTown() {
  update(locations[0]);
}
 ```

## 64

- Now your update function needs to use the argument you pass into it.

Inside the update function, change the value of the button1.innerText assignment to be location["button text"]. That way, you use bracket notation to get the "button text" property of the location object passed into the function.

```html
function update(location) {
  button1.innerText = location["button text"];
  button2.innerText = "Go to cave";
  button3.innerText = "Fight dragon";
  button1.onclick = goStore;
  button2.onclick = goCave;
  button3.onclick = fightDragon;
  text.innerText = "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store\".";
}
```

## 65

- location["button text"] is an array with three elements. Change the button1.innerText assignment to be which represents the first element of the array.

```html
function update(location) {
  button1.innerText = location["button text"][0];
  button2.innerText = "Go to cave";
  button3.innerText = "Fight dragon";
  button1.onclick = goStore;
  button2.onclick = goCave;
  button3.onclick = fightDragon;
  text.innerText = "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store\".";
}
```

## 66

- Now update button2.innerText and button3.innerText to be assigned the second and third values of the "button text" array, respectively.

```html
function update(location) {
  button1.innerText = location["button text"][0];
  button2.innerText = location["button text"][1];
  button3.innerText = location["button text"][2];
  button1.onclick = goStore;
  button2.onclick = goCave;
  button3.onclick = fightDragon;
  text.innerText = "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store\".";
}
```

## 67

- Following the same pattern as you did for the button text, update the three buttons' onclick assignments to be the first, second, and third values of the "button functions" array.

```html
function update(location) {
  button1.innerText = location["button text"][0];
  button2.innerText = location["button text"][1];
  button3.innerText = location["button text"][2];
  button1.onclick = location["button functions"][0];
  button2.onclick = location["button functions"][1];;
  button3.onclick = location["button functions"][2];;
  text.innerText = "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store.\"";
}
```

## 68

- Finally, update the text.innerText assignment to equal the text from the location object. However, instead of using bracket notation, use dot notation.

Here is an example of accessing the name property of an object called person:

Example Code
person.name

```html
function update(location) {
  button1.innerText = location["button text"][0];
  button2.innerText = location["button text"][1];
  button3.innerText = location["button text"][2];
  button1.onclick = location["button functions"][0];
  button2.onclick = location["button functions"][1];
  button3.onclick = location["button functions"][2];
  text.innerText = location.text;
}
```

## 69

- Now update your goStore function to call the update function. Pass the second element of the locations array as your argument.

To make sure your refactoring is correct, try clicking your first button again. You should see the same changes to your webpage that you saw earlier.

```html
function goStore() {
  update(locations[1]);
}
```

## 70

- Create two more empty functions named fightSlime and fightBeast. These functions will be used in your upcoming cave object.

```html
function fightSlime() {

}

function fightBeast() {

}
```

## 71

- Add a third object to the locations array. Give it the same properties as the other two objects.

Set name to cave. Set button text to an array with the strings "Fight slime", "Fight fanged beast", and "Go to town square". Set the "button functions" to an array with the variables fightSlime, fightBeast, and goTown. Set the text property to "You enter the cave. You see some monsters.".

```html
{
    name: "cave",
    "button text": ["Fight slime", "Fight fanged beast", "Go to town square"],
    "button functions": [fightSlime, fightBeast, goTown],
    text: "You enter the cave. You see some monsters."
    }
```

## 72

- Now that you have a "cave" location object, update your goCave function to call update and pass that new "cave" location. Remember that this is the third element in your locations array.

Don't forget to remove your console.log call!

```html
function goCave() {
  update(locations[2]);
}
```

## 73

- Now that your "store" and "cave" locations are complete, you can code the actions the player takes at those locations. Inside the buyHealth function, set gold equal to gold minus 10.

For example, here is how you would set num equal to 5 less than num: num = num - 5;.

```html
function buyHealth() {
  gold = gold - 10;
}
```

## 74

- After the gold is updated, add a line to set health equal to health plus 10.

```html
function buyHealth() {
  gold = gold - 10;
  health = health + 10;
}
```

## 75

- There is a shorthand way to add or subtract from a variable called compound assignment. For example, changing num = num + 5 to compound assignment would look like num += 5.

Update both lines inside your buyHealth function to use compound assignment.

```html
function buyHealth() {
  gold -= 10;
  health += 10;
}
```

## 76

- Now that you are updating the gold and health variables, you need to display those new values on the game screen. You have retrieved the healthText and goldText elements in a prior step.

After your assignment lines, assign the innerText property of goldText to be the variable gold. Use the same pattern to update healthText with the health variable.

You can test this by clicking your "Go to store" button, followed by your "Buy Health" button.

Note: Your answer should only be two lines of code.

```html
function buyHealth() {
  gold -= 10;
  health += 10;
  goldText.innerText = gold;
healthText.innerText = health;
}
```

## 77

- What if the player doesn't have enough gold to buy health? You should use an if statement to check if the player has enough gold to buy health.

In the previous project, you learned how to work with if statements like this:

Example Code
const num = 5;
if (num >= 3) {
  console.log("This code will run because num is greater than or equal to 3.");
}
Start by placing all of the code in your buyHealth function inside an if statement. For the if statement condition, check if gold is greater than or equal to 10.

```html
function buyHealth() {
  if (gold >= 10){
  gold -= 10;
  health += 10;
  goldText.innerText = gold;
  healthText.innerText = health;
  }
}
```

## 78

- Now when a player tries to buy health, it will only work if they have enough money. If they do not, nothing will happen. Add an else statement where you can put code to run if a player does not have enough money.

In the previous project, you learned how to work with else statements like this:

Example Code
if (num >= 5) {

} else {

}

```html
function buyHealth() {
  if (gold >= 10) {
    gold -= 10;
    health += 10;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    healthText.innerText = health;
  }
  else {
    
  }
}
```

## 79

- Inside the else statement, set text.innerText to equal "You do not have enough gold to buy health.".

```html
function buyHealth() {
  if (gold >= 10) {
    gold -= 10;
    health += 10;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    healthText.innerText = health;
  } else {
    text.innerText = "You do not have enough gold to buy health.";
  }
}
```

## 80

- Use const to create a weapons variable above your locations array. Assign it an empty array.

```html
const weapons = [];

```

## 81

- Just like your locations array, your weapons array will hold objects. Add four objects to the weapons array, each with two properties: name and power. The first should have the name set to "stick" and the power set to 5. The second should be "dagger" and 30. The third, "claw hammer" and 50. The fourth, "sword" and 100.

```html
const weapons = [
    { name: "stick", power: 5 },
    { name: "dagger", power: 30 },
    { name: "claw hammer", power: 50 },
    { name: "sword", power: 100 }
    ];
```

## 82

- Inside your buyWeapon function, add an if statement to check if gold is greater than or equal to 30.

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if (gold >= 30){

  }
}
```

## 83

- Similar to your buyHealth function, set gold equal to 30 less than its current value. Make sure this is inside your if statement.

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if (gold >= 30) {
    gold -= 30;
  }
}
```

## 84

- The value of the currentWeaponIndex variable corresponds to an index in the weapons array. The player starts with a "stick", since currentWeaponIndex starts at 0 and weapons[0] is the "stick" weapon.

In the buyWeapon function, use compound assignment to add 1 to currentWeaponIndex - the user is buying the next weapon in the weapons array.

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if (gold >= 30) {
    gold -= 30;
    currentWeaponIndex += 1;
  }
}
```

## 85

- In the previous project, you learned how to use the increment operator to increase a variable by 1.

Example Code
let num = 5;
num++;
// prints 6
console.log(num);
Change your currentWeaponIndex assignment to use the increment operator.

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if (gold >= 30) {
    gold -= 30;
    currentWeaponIndex++;
  }
}
```

## 86

- Now update the goldText element to display the new value of gold, and update the text element to display "You now have a new weapon.".

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if (gold >= 30) {
    gold -= 30;
    currentWeaponIndex++;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    text.innerText = "You now have a new weapon.";
  }
}
```

## 87

- You should tell the player what weapon they bought. In between the two lines you just wrote, use let to initialize a new variable called newWeapon. Set this to equal weapons.

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if (gold >= 30) {
    gold -= 30;
    currentWeaponIndex++;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    let newWeapon = weapons;
    text.innerText = "You now have a new weapon.";
  }
}
```

## 88

- Use bracket notation to access an object within the weapons array and assign it to your newWeapon variable. Place the variable currentWeaponIndex within the brackets.

When you use a variable in bracket notation, you are accessing the property or index by the value of that variable.

For example, this code uses the index variable to access a value of array.

Example Code
let value = array[index];

```html
let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex];
```

## 89

- weapons[currentWeaponIndex] is an object. Use dot notation to get the name property of that object.

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if (gold >= 30) {
    gold -= 30;
    currentWeaponIndex++;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
    text.innerText = "You now have a new weapon.";
  }
}
 ```

## 90

- In the previous project, you learned how to work with the concatenation operator to insert variables into a string like this:

Example Code
const organization = "freeCodeCamp";

// "Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp."
"Hello, our name is " + organization + ".";
Update the string "You now have a new weapon." to "You now have a " followed by the name of the new weapon, and remember to end the sentence with a period.

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if (gold >= 30) {
    gold -= 30;
    currentWeaponIndex++;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
    text.innerText = "You now have a " + newWeapon + ".";
  }
}
 ```

## 91

- Back at the beginning of this project, you created the inventory array. Add the newWeapon to the end of the inventory array using the push() method.

In the previous project, you learned how to work with the push method like this:

Example Code
const myArray = [];
myArray.push("new item");
// myArray is now ["new item"]

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if (gold >= 30) {
    gold -= 30;
    currentWeaponIndex++;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
    text.innerText = "You now have a " + newWeapon + ".";
    inventory.push(newWeapon);
  }
}
 ```

## 92

- Up until now, any time text.innerText was updated, the old text was erased. This time, use the += operator to add text to the end of text.innerText.

Add the string " In your inventory you have: " - include the spaces at the beginning and the end.

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if (gold >= 30) {
    gold -= 30;
    currentWeaponIndex++;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
    text.innerText = "You now have a " + newWeapon + ".";
    inventory.push(newWeapon);
    text.innerText += " In your inventory you have: ";
  }
}
 ```

## 93

- At the end of the second text.innerText string you just added, use the concatenation operator to add the contents of inventory to the string.

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if (gold >= 30) {
    gold -= 30;
    currentWeaponIndex++;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
    text.innerText = "You now have a " + newWeapon + ".";
    inventory.push(newWeapon);
    text.innerText += " In your inventory you have: " + inventory;
  }
}
 ```

## 94

- Add an else statement to your buyWeapon function. In that statement, set text.innerText to equal "You do not have enough gold to buy a weapon.".

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if (gold >= 30) {
    gold -= 30;
    currentWeaponIndex++;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
    text.innerText = "You now have a " + newWeapon + ".";
    inventory.push(newWeapon);
    text.innerText += " In your inventory you have: " + inventory;
  }
  else {
    text.innerText = "You do not have enough gold to buy a weapon.";
  }
}
 ```

## 95

- Once a player has the best weapon, they cannot buy another one. Wrap all of the code in your buyWeapon function inside another if statement. The condition should check if currentWeaponIndex is less than 3 - the index of the last weapon.

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if(currentWeaponIndex < 3) {
  if (gold >= 30) {
    gold -= 30;
    currentWeaponIndex++;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
    text.innerText = "You now have a " + newWeapon + ".";
    inventory.push(newWeapon);
    text.innerText += " In your inventory you have: " + inventory;
  } else {
    text.innerText = "You do not have enough gold to buy a weapon.";
  }
      }
}
 ```

## 96

- Arrays have a length property that returns the number of items in the array. You may want to add new values to the weapons array in the future.

Change your if condition to check if currentWeaponIndex is less than the length of the weapons array. An example of checking the length of an array myArray would look like myArray.length

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if (currentWeaponIndex < weapons.length) {
    if (gold >= 30) {
      gold -= 30;
      currentWeaponIndex++;
      goldText.innerText = gold;
      let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
      text.innerText = "You now have a " + newWeapon + ".";
      inventory.push(newWeapon);
      text.innerText += " In your inventory you have: " + inventory;
    } else {
      text.innerText = "You do not have enough gold to buy a weapon.";
    }
  }
}
 ```

## 97

- Now it is time to test your buyWeapon function. Right now, the gold amount is set to 50. But to properly see the results of your buyWeapon function, the amount should be set to something higher.

Update the gold amount to 250.

NOTE: The HTML has already been updated to reflect this change.

To test your buyWeapon function, open up the console. Then click on the "Go to store" button followed by the "Buy weapon (30 gold)" button four times.

```html
let gold = 250;

```

## 98

- When you were testing your function, you should have seen an error message in the console. This error is due to the condition in the buyWeapon function.

The currentWeaponIndex variable is the index of the weapons array, but array indexing starts at zero. The index of the last element in an array is one less than the length of the array.

Change the if condition to check weapons.length - 1, instead of weapons.length.

Test out your buyWeapon function again to see the error message disappear.

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if (currentWeaponIndex < weapons.length - 1) {
    if (gold >= 30) {
      gold -= 30;
      currentWeaponIndex++;
      goldText.innerText = gold;
      let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
      text.innerText = "You now have a " + newWeapon + ".";
      inventory.push(newWeapon);
      text.innerText += " In your inventory you have: " + inventory;
    } else {
      text.innerText = "You do not have enough gold to buy a weapon.";
    }
  }
}
```

## 99

- If the player has purchased all of the weapons in the inventory, the player should not be able to purchase any more and a message should be displayed.

Add an else statement for your outer if statement. Inside this new else statement, set text.innerText to "You already have the most powerful weapon!".

Test your buyWeapon function again to make sure the message is displayed when the player has the most powerful weapon.

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if (currentWeaponIndex < weapons.length - 1) {
    if (gold >= 30) {
      gold -= 30;
      currentWeaponIndex++;
      goldText.innerText = gold;
      let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
      text.innerText = "You now have a " + newWeapon + ".";
      inventory.push(newWeapon);
      text.innerText += " In your inventory you have: " + inventory;
    } else {
      text.innerText = "You do not have enough gold to buy a weapon.";
    }
  } 
  else {
    text.innerText = "You already have the most powerful weapon!";
  }
}
```

## 100

- Now that you are finished testing that portion of the buyWeapon function, you can set your gold variable back to 50.

Note: The HTML has already been updated to reflect the original value of gold.

```html
let gold = 50;
```

## 101

- Once a player has the most powerful weapon, you can give them the ability to sell their old weapons.

In the outer else statement, set button2.innerText to "Sell weapon for 15 gold". Also set button2.onclick to the function name sellWeapon.

```html
function buyWeapon() {
  if (currentWeaponIndex < weapons.length - 1) {
    if (gold >= 30) {
      gold -= 30;
      currentWeaponIndex++;
      goldText.innerText = gold;
      let newWeapon = weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name;
      text.innerText = "You now have a " + newWeapon + ".";
      inventory.push(newWeapon);
      text.innerText += " In your inventory you have: " + inventory;
    } else {
      text.innerText = "You do not have enough gold to buy a weapon.";
    }
  } else {
    text.innerText = "You already have the most powerful weapon!";
    button2.innerText = "Sell weapon for 15 gold";
    button2.onclick = sellWeapon;
  }
}
```

## 102

- Create an empty sellWeapon function.

```html
function sellWeapon() {

}
```

## 103

- Players should not be able to sell their only weapon. Inside the sellWeapon function, add an if statement with a condition that checks if the length of the inventory array is greater than 1.

```html
function sellWeapon() {
  if (inventory.length > 1) {

  }
}
```

## 104

- Inside the if statement, set gold equal to 15 more than its current value. Also update goldText.innerText to the new value.

```html
function sellWeapon() {
  if (inventory.length > 1) {
    gold += 15;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
  }
}
```

## 105

- The next step is to create a variable called currentWeapon.

Example Code
let num = 1;
if (num === 1) {
  let num = 2; // this num is scoped to the if statement
  console.log(num); // expected output: 2
}
console.log(num); // expected output: 1 (the global variable)
Use the let keyword to create a variable named currentWeapon. Don't assign it a value yet.

```html
function sellWeapon() {
  let currentWeapon;
  if (inventory.length > 1) {
    gold += 15;
    goldText.innerText = gold;

  }
}
```

## 106

- In the previous project, you learned how to work with the shift() method to remove the first element from an array like this:

Example Code
const myArray = ["first", "second", "third"];
const firstElement = myArray.shift();
// myArray is now ["second", "third"]
Use the shift() method to take the first element from the inventory array and assign it to your currentWeapon variable.

```html
function sellWeapon() {
  if (inventory.length > 1) {
    gold += 15;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    let currentWeapon = inventory.shift();
  }
}
```

## 107

- After your currentWeapon, use the concatenation operator to set text.innerText to the string "You sold a ", then currentWeapon, then the string ".".

```html
function sellWeapon() {
  if (inventory.length > 1) {
    gold += 15;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    let currentWeapon = inventory.shift();
  text.innerText = "You sold a " + currentWeapon + ".";
  }
}
```

## 108

- Now use the += operator to add the string " In your inventory you have: " and the contents of inventory to the text.innerText. Make sure to include the space at the beginning and end of the " In your inventory you have: " string.

```html
function sellWeapon() {
  if (inventory.length > 1) {
    gold += 15;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    let currentWeapon = inventory.shift();
    text.innerText = "You sold a " + currentWeapon + ".";
    text.innerText += " In your inventory you have: " + inventory;
  }
}
```

## 109

- Use an else statement to run when the inventory length is not more than one. Set the text.innerText to say "Don't sell your only weapon!".

```html
function sellWeapon() {
  if (inventory.length > 1) {
    gold += 15;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    let currentWeapon = inventory.shift();
    text.innerText = "You sold a " + currentWeapon + ".";
    text.innerText += " In your inventory you have: " + inventory;
  }
  else {
    text.innerText = "Don't sell your only weapon!";
  }
}
```

## 110

- Now you can start the code to fight monsters. To keep your code organized, your fightDragon function has been moved for you to be near the other fight functions.

Below your weapons array, define a monsters variable and assign it an array. Set that array to have three objects, each with a name, level, and health properties. The first object's values should be "slime", 2, and 15, in order. The second should be "fanged beast", 8, and 60. The third should be "dragon", 20, and 300.

```html
const monsters = [{ name: "slime", level: 2, health: 15 },
    { name: "fanged beast", level: 8, health: 60 },
    { name: "dragon", level: 20, health: 300 } ];
```

## 111

- Fighting each type of monster will use similar logic. Create an empty function called goFight to manage this logic.

```html
function goFight() {

}
```

## 112

- In your fightSlime function, set fighting equal to 0 - the index of slime in the monsters array. Remember that you already declared fighting earlier in your code, so you do not need let or const here.

On the next line, call the goFight function.

```html
function fightSlime() {
  fighting = 0;
  goFight();
}
```

## 113

- Following the same pattern as the fightSlime function, use that code in the fightBeast and fightDragon functions. Remember that beast is at index 1 and dragon is at index 2. Also, remove the console.log call from your fightDragon function.

```html
function fightBeast() {
fighting = 1;
  goFight();
}

function fightDragon() {
  fighting = 2;
  goFight();
}
```

## 114

- At the end of your code, create two empty functions named attack and dodge.

```html
function attack() {

}

function dodge() {
  
}
```

## 115

- Add a new object to the end of the locations array, following the same properties as the rest of the objects. Set name to "fight", "button text" to an array with "Attack", "Dodge", and "Run", "button functions" to an array with attack, dodge, and goTown, and text to "You are fighting a monster.".

```html
const locations = [
  {
    name: "town square",
    "button text": ["Go to store", "Go to cave", "Fight dragon"],
    "button functions": [goStore, goCave, fightDragon],
    text: "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store\"."
  },
  {
    name: "store",
    "button text": ["Buy 10 health (10 gold)", "Buy weapon (30 gold)", "Go to town square"],
    "button functions": [buyHealth, buyWeapon, goTown],
    text: "You enter the store."
  },
  {
    name: "cave",
    "button text": ["Fight slime", "Fight fanged beast", "Go to town square"],
    "button functions": [fightSlime, fightBeast, goTown],
    text: "You enter the cave. You see some monsters."
  },
  {
    name: "fight",
    "button text": ["Attack", "Dodge", "Run"],
    "button functions": [attack, dodge, goTown],
    text: "You are fighting a monster."
  }
];
```

## 116

- In the goFight function, call your update function with the fourth object in locations as an argument.

```html
function goFight() {
  update(locations[3]);
}
```

## 117

- Below your update call, set the monsterHealth to be the health of the current monster. You can get this value by accessing the health property of monsters[fighting] with dot notation.

```html
function goFight() {
  update(locations[3]);
  monsterHealth = monsters[fighting].health;
}
```

## 118

- By default, the HTML element that shows the monster's stats has been hidden with CSS. When the player clicks the "Fight dragon" button, the monster's stats should be displayed. You can accomplish this by using the style and display properties on the monsterStats element.

The style property is used to access the inline style of an element and the display property is used to set the visibility of an element.

Here is an example of how to update the display for a paragraph element:

Example Code
const paragraph = document.querySelector('p');
paragraph.style.display = 'block';
Display the monsterStats element by updating the display property of the style property to block.

```html
function goFight() {
  update(locations[3]);
  monsterHealth = monsters[fighting].health;
  monsterStats .style.display = 'block';
}
```

## 119

- Now, you will need to update the text for the current monster's name and health.

Start by assigning monsters[fighting].name to the innerText property of monsterName. Then, assign monsterHealth to the innerText property of monsterHealthText.

```html
function goFight() {
  update(locations[3]);
  monsterHealth = monsters[fighting].health;
  monsterStats.style.display = "block";
  monsterName.innerText = monsters[fighting].name; 
  monsterHealthText.innerText = monsterHealth;
}
```

## 120

- Now you can build the attack function. First, update the text message to say "The  attacks.", replacing  with the name of the monster. Remember you can use the concatenation operator for this.

```html
function attack() {
  text.innerText = "The " + monsters[fighting].name + " attacks.";
}
```

## 121

- On a new line, use the addition assignment operator(+=), to add the string " You attack it with your ." to the text value, replacing  with the player's current weapon. Additionally, remember that this line of text starts with a space so it will properly display.

```html
function attack() {
  text.innerText = "The " + monsters[fighting].name + " attacks.";
  text.innerText += " You attack it with your " + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + ".";
}
```

## 122

- Next, set health to equal health minus the monster's level. Remember you can get this from the monsters[fighting].level property.

```html
function attack() {
  text.innerText = "The " + monsters[fighting].name + " attacks.";
  text.innerText += " You attack it with your " + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + ".";
  health -= monsters[fighting].level;
}
```

## 123

- Set monsterHealth to monsterHealth minus the power of the player's current weapon.

Remember that you can access the power of the player's current weapon using weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power.

```html
function attack() {
  text.innerText = "The " + monsters[fighting].name + " attacks.";
  text.innerText += " You attack it with your " + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + ".";
  health -= monsters[fighting].level;
  monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power;
}
```

## 124

- The Math object in JavaScript contains static properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. One of those is Math.random(), which generates a random number from 0 (inclusive) to 1 (exclusive). Another is Math.floor(), which rounds a given number down to the nearest integer.

Using these, you can generate a random number within a range. For example, this generates a random number between 1 and 5: Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;.

Following this pattern, use the addition operator (+) to add a random number between 1 and the value of xp to your monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power.

```html
 monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;;
```

## 125

- Update healthText.innerText and monsterHealthText.innerText to equal health and monsterHealth.

```html
function attack() {
  text.innerText = "The " + monsters[fighting].name + " attacks.";
  text.innerText += " You attack it with your " + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + ".";
  health -= monsters[fighting].level;
  monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;
  healthText.innerText = health;
  monsterHealthText.innerText = monsterHealth;
}
```

## 126

- Add an if statement to check if health is less than or equal to 0. If it is, call the lose function.

```html
function attack() {
  text.innerText = "The " + monsters[fighting].name + " attacks.";
  text.innerText += " You attack it with your " + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + ".";
  health -= monsters[fighting].level;
  monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;
  healthText.innerText = health;
  monsterHealthText.innerText = monsterHealth;
  if (health <= 0) {
    lose();
  }
}
```

## 127

- You can make an else statement conditional by using else if. Here's an example:

Example Code
if (num > 10) {

} else if (num < 5) {

}
At the end of your if statement, add an else if statement to check if monsterHealth is less than or equal to 0. In your else if, call the defeatMonster function.

```html
 monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;;
```

## 128

- At the end of your code, create the defeatMonster and lose functions. Leave them empty for now.

```html
function defeatMonster() {

}

function lose() {
  
}
```

## 129

- Inside the dodge function, set text.innerText equal to the string "You dodge the attack from the ". Replace  with the name of the monster, using the name property.

```html
function dodge() {
  text.innerText = "You dodge the attack from the " + monsters[fighting].name + ".";
}
```

## 130

- In your defeatMonster function, set gold equal to gold plus the monster's level times 6.7. Remember you can get the monster's level by using monsters[fighting].level.

Here is an example of setting num to num plus 5 * 8: num +=  8. Use Math.floor() to round the result down.

```html
function defeatMonster() {
  gold += Math.floor(monsters[fighting].level * 6.7);
}
```

## 131

- Set xp to xp plus the monster's level.

```html
function defeatMonster() {
  gold += Math.floor(monsters[fighting].level * 6.7);
  xp += monsters[fighting].level;
}
```

## 132

- Now update goldText and xpText to display the updated values.

```html
function defeatMonster() {
  gold += Math.floor(monsters[fighting].level * 6.7);
  xp += monsters[fighting].level;
  goldText.innerText = gold;
  xpText.innerText = xp;
}
```

## 133

- Finish the defeatMonster function by calling the update function with locations[4] as the argument.

```html
function defeatMonster() {
  gold += Math.floor(monsters[fighting].level * 6.7);
  xp += monsters[fighting].level;
  goldText.innerText = gold;
  xpText.innerText = xp;
  update(locations[4]);
}
```

## 134

- Your locations array doesn't have a fifth element, so locations[4] doesn't work.

Add a new object at the end of the locations array, following the same structure as the other objects. Set name to "kill monster", set "button text" to an array with three "Go to town square" strings, set "button functions" to an array with three goTown variables, and set text to "The monster screams Arg! as it dies. You gain experience points and find gold.".

```html
const locations = [
  {
    name: "town square",
    "button text": ["Go to store", "Go to cave", "Fight dragon"],
    "button functions": [goStore, goCave, fightDragon],
    text: "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store\"."
  },
  {
    name: "store",
    "button text": ["Buy 10 health (10 gold)", "Buy weapon (30 gold)", "Go to town square"],
    "button functions": [buyHealth, buyWeapon, goTown],
    text: "You enter the store."
  },
  {
    name: "cave",
    "button text": ["Fight slime", "Fight fanged beast", "Go to town square"],
    "button functions": [fightSlime, fightBeast, goTown],
    text: "You enter the cave. You see some monsters."
  },
  {
    name: "fight",
    "button text": ["Attack", "Dodge", "Run"],
    "button functions": [attack, dodge, goTown],
    text: "You are fighting a monster."
  },
  {
    name: "kill monster",
    "button text": ["Go to town square", "Go to town square", "Go to town square"],
    "button functions": [goTown , goTown , goTown],
    text: "The monster screams Arg! as it dies. You gain experience points and find gold."
  }
];
```

## 135

- Add an if statement to check if health is less than or equal to 0. If it is, call the lose function.

```html
{
    name: "kill monster",
    "button text": ["Go to town square", "Go to town square", "Go to town square"],
    "button functions": [goTown, goTown, goTown],
    text: 'The monster screams "Arg!" as it dies. You gain experience points and find gold.'
  }
```

## 136

- After a monster is defeated, the monster's stat box should no longer display.

On the first line of the update function, use monsterStats.style.display to change the display value to none.

```html
 function update(location) {
  monsterStats.style.display = "none";
  button1.innerText = location["button text"][0];
  button2.innerText = location["button text"][1];
  button3.innerText = location["button text"][2];
  button1.onclick = location["button functions"][0];
  button2.onclick = location["button functions"][1];
  button3.onclick = location["button functions"][2];
  text.innerText = location.text;
}
```

## 137

- In the lose function, call the update function and pass in the sixth object of your locations array. Note that you haven't created this object just yet.

```html
function lose() {
  update(locations[5]);
}
```

## 138

- At the end of your code, create a restart function. Inside this function, set xp to 0, health to 100, gold to 50, currentWeaponIndex to 0, and set inventory to an array with the string stick.

Also update the innerText properties of goldText, healthText, and xpText to their current values.

Finally, call the goTown() function.

```html
function restart() {
  xp = 0;
  health = 100;
  gold = 50;
  currentWeaponIndex = 0;
  inventory = ["stick"];
  goTown();
  goldText.innerText = gold;
  goldText.innerText = gold;
  healthText.innerText = health;
  xpText.innerText = xp;
}
```

## 139

- In the locations array, add another object at the end. Set the name property to "lose", set "button text" to an array with three "REPLAY?" strings, set "button functions" to an array with three restart variables, and set text to "You die. &#x2620;".

In a later step, you will update the code for the &#x2620; emoticon text to properly display on the page.

```html
{
    name: "lose",
    "button text": ["REPLAY?", "REPLAY?", "REPLAY?"],
    "button functions": [restart , restart , restart ],
    text: "You die. &#x2620;"
  },
```

## 140

- Back to your attack function - inside the else if block, create another if and else statement. If the player is fighting the dragon (fighting would be 2), call the winGame function. Move the defeatMonster() call to the else block.

For this step, you will need to use the strict equality (===) operator to check if fighting is equal to 2.

```html
function attack() {
  text.innerText = "The " + monsters[fighting].name + " attacks.";
  text.innerText += " You attack it with your " + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + ".";
  health -= monsters[fighting].level;
  monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;
  healthText.innerText = health;
  monsterHealthText.innerText = monsterHealth;
  if (health <= 0) {
    lose();
  } else if (monsterHealth <= 0) {
    defeatMonster();
    if (fighting === 2) {
        winGame();
    } 
    else {
        defeatMonster();
    }
    }
  }
```

## 141

- In order for the &#x2620; emoticon text to properly display on the page, you will need to use the innerHTML property.

The innerHTML property allows you to access or modify the content inside an HTML element using JavaScript.

Here is an example of updating the content for this paragraph element using the innerHTML property.

Example Code
This is a paragraph.</p>
Example Code
document.querySelector("#demo").innerHTML = "Hello, innerHTML!";
In the update function, change text.innerText to text.innerHTML.

```html
monsterStats.style.display = "none";
  button1.innerText = location["button text"][0];
  button2.innerText = location["button text"][1];
  button3.innerText = location["button text"][2];
  button1.onclick = location["button functions"][0];
  button2.onclick = location["button functions"][1];
  button3.onclick = location["button functions"][2];
  text.innerHTML = location.text;
```

## 142

- After the lose function, create a function called winGame. Inside the winGame function, call the update function and pass in locations[6].

```html
function winGame() {
  update(locations[6]);
}
```

## 143

- Add another object in the locations array. Everything should be the same as the lose object, except the name should be "win" and the text should be "You defeat the dragon! YOU WIN THE GAME! &#x1F389;".

```html
{
    name: "lose",
    "button text": ["REPLAY?", "REPLAY?", "REPLAY?"],
    "button functions": [restart, restart, restart],
    text: "You die. &#x2620;"
  },
  {
    name: "win",
    "button text": ["REPLAY?", "REPLAY?", "REPLAY?"],
    "button functions": [restart, restart, restart],
    text: "You defeat the dragon! YOU WIN THE GAME! &#x1F389;"
  }
```

## 144

- While your game is feature-complete at this stage, there are things you can do to make it more fun and engaging. To get started, you'll give monsters a dynamic attack value.

Inside your attack function, change your health -= monsters[fighting].level; line to health -= getMonsterAttackValue(monsters[fighting].level);. This sets health equal to health minus the return value of the getMonsterAttackValue function, and passes the level of the monster as an argument.

```html
function attack() {
  text.innerText = "The " + monsters[fighting].name + " attacks.";
  text.innerText += " You attack it with your " + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + ".";
  health -= getMonsterAttackValue(monsters[fighting].level);
  monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;
  healthText.innerText = health;
  monsterHealthText.innerText = monsterHealth;
  if (health <= 0) {
    lose();
  } else if (monsterHealth <= 0) {
    if (fighting === 2) {
      winGame();
    } else {
      defeatMonster();
    }
  }
}
```

## 145

- Below your attack function, create an empty function named getMonsterAttackValue. It should take level as a parameter.

```html
getMonsterAttackValue
```

## 146

- The attack of the monster will be based on the monster's level and the player's xp. In the getMonsterAttackValue function, use const to create a variable called hit. Assign it the equation (level *5) - (Math.floor(Math.random()* xp));.

This will set the monster's attack to five times their level minus a random number between 0 and the player's xp.

```html
function getMonsterAttackValue(level) {
  const hit = (level * 5) - (Math.floor(Math.random() * xp));
}
```

## 147

- Log the value of hit to the console to use in debugging. Remember that you can do this with console.log().

```html
function getMonsterAttackValue(level) {
  const hit = (level * 5) - (Math.floor(Math.random() * xp));
  console.log(hit);
}
```

## 148

- In the previous project, you learned how to work with the return keyword to return a value from a function like this:

Example Code
function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
Use the return keyword to return the value of hit at the end of the function.

```html
function getMonsterAttackValue(level) {
  const hit = (level * 5) - (Math.floor(Math.random() * xp));
  return hit;
}
```

## 149

- If you play the game in its current state you might notice a bug. If your xp is high enough, the getMonsterAttackValue function will return a negative number, which will actually add to your total health when fighting a monster! You can fix this issue by using a ternary operator to ensure negative values are not returned.

The ternary operator is a conditional operator and can be used as a one-line if-else statement. The syntax is: condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse.

Here is an example of returning a value using an if-else statement and a refactored example using a ternary operator:

Example Code
// if-else statement
if (score > 0) {
  return score
} else {
  return default_score
}

// ternary operator
return score > 0 ? score : default_score
In getMonsterAttackValue, change return hit to a ternary operator that returns hit if hit is greater than 0, or returns 0 if it is not.

```html
function getMonsterAttackValue(level) {
  const hit = (level * 5) - (Math.floor(Math.random() * xp));
  console.log(hit);
  return hit > 0 ? hit : 0;
}
```

## 150

- In your attack function, find the line of code that updates the monsterHealth variable and place it within an if block with a condition that calls the isMonsterHit function.

```html
function attack() {
  text.innerText = "The " + monsters[fighting].name + " attacks.";
  text.innerText += " You attack it with your " + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + ".";
  health -= getMonsterAttackValue(monsters[fighting].level);
  healthText.innerText = health;
  monsterHealthText.innerText = monsterHealth;
  if (isMonsterHit()) {
  monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;
  }
  if (health <= 0) {
    lose();
  } else if (monsterHealth <= 0) {
    if (fighting === 2) {
      winGame();
    } else {
      defeatMonster();
    }
  }
}
```

## 151

- Add an else statement to the first if statement inside your attack() function. In the else statement, use the += operator to add the text " You miss." to the end of text.innerText.

```html
function attack() {
  text.innerText = "The " + monsters[fighting].name + " attacks.";
  text.innerText += " You attack it with your " + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + ".";
  health -= getMonsterAttackValue(monsters[fighting].level);
  if (isMonsterHit()) {
    monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;    
  } 
  else {
    text.innerText += " You miss.";
  }
  healthText.innerText = health;
  monsterHealthText.innerText = monsterHealth;
  if (health <= 0) {
    lose();
  } else if (monsterHealth <= 0) {
    if (fighting === 2) {
      winGame();
    } else {
      defeatMonster();
    }
  }
}
```

## 152

- Now create the isMonsterHit function. This will return a boolean value (true or false) to be used in your if statement. Return the result of the comparison Math.random() > .2.

```html
 function isMonsterHit () {
return Math.random() > .2;
}
```

## 153

- The player should hit if either Math.random() > .2 or if the player's health is less than 20.

At the end of your return statement, use the logical OR operator || and check if health is less than 20.

The logical OR operator will use the first value if it is truthy â€“ that is, anything apart from NaN, null, undefined, 0, -0, 0n, "", and false. Otherwise, it will use the second value.

For example: num < 10 || num > 20.

```html
function isMonsterHit() {
  return Math.random() > 0.2 || health < 20;
}
```

## 154

- On every attack, there should be a chance that the player's weapon breaks. At the end of the attack function, add an empty if statement with the condition Math.random() <= .1.

```html
function attack() {
  text.innerText = "The " + monsters[fighting].name + " attacks.";
  text.innerText += " You attack it with your " + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + ".";
  health -= getMonsterAttackValue(monsters[fighting].level);
  if (isMonsterHit()) {
    monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;    
  } else {
    text.innerText += " You miss.";
  }
  healthText.innerText = health;
  monsterHealthText.innerText = monsterHealth;
  if (health <= 0) {
    lose();
  } else if (monsterHealth <= 0) {
    if (fighting === 2) {
      winGame();
    } else {
      defeatMonster();
    }
  }
  if(Math.random() <= .1) {

  }
}
```

## 155

- Use the += operator to add " Your > breaks.", with a space in front of Your, to the end of text.innerText. Replace  with the last item in the inventory array using inventory.pop(), which will remove the last item in the array AND return it so it appears in your string.

```html
function attack() {
  text.innerText = "The " + monsters[fighting].name + " attacks.";
  text.innerText += " You attack it with your " + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + ".";
  health -= getMonsterAttackValue(monsters[fighting].level);
  if (isMonsterHit()) {
    monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;    
  } else {
    text.innerText += " You miss.";
  }
  healthText.innerText = health;
  monsterHealthText.innerText = monsterHealth;
  if (health <= 0) {
    lose();
  } else if (monsterHealth <= 0) {
    if (fighting === 2) {
      winGame();
    } else {
      defeatMonster();
    }
  }
  if (Math.random() <= .1) {
    text.innerText += " Your " + inventory.pop() + " breaks.";
  }
}
```

## 156

- Remember that the increment operator ++ can be used to increase a variable's value by 1. There is also a decrement operator -- that can be used to decrease a variable's value by 1. For example :

Example Code
let num = 10;
num--;
console.log(num); // Output: 9
Decrement the value of currentWeaponIndex in your if statement, after you update the text.

```html
function attack() {
  text.innerText = "The " + monsters[fighting].name + " attacks.";
  text.innerText += " You attack it with your " + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + ".";
  health -= getMonsterAttackValue(monsters[fighting].level);
  if (isMonsterHit()) {
    monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;    
  } else {
    text.innerText += " You miss.";
  }
  healthText.innerText = health;
  monsterHealthText.innerText = monsterHealth;
  if (health <= 0) {
    lose();
  } else if (monsterHealth <= 0) {
    if (fighting === 2) {
      winGame();
    } else {
      defeatMonster();
    }
  }
  if (Math.random() <= .1) {
    text.innerText += " Your " + inventory.pop() + " breaks.";
    currentWeaponIndex--;

- We don't want a player's only weapon to break. The logical AND operator checks if two statements are true.

Use the logical AND operator && to add a second condition to your if statement. The player's weapon should only break if inventory.length does not equal (!==) one.

Here is an example of an if statement with two conditions:

Example Code
if (firstName === "Quincy" && lastName === "Larson") {

}

```html
function attack() {
  text.innerText = "The " + monsters[fighting].name + " attacks.";
  text.innerText += " You attack it with your " + weapons[currentWeaponIndex].name + ".";
  health -= getMonsterAttackValue(monsters[fighting].level);
  if (isMonsterHit()) {
    monsterHealth -= weapons[currentWeaponIndex].power + Math.floor(Math.random() * xp) + 1;    
  } else {
    text.innerText += " You miss.";
  }
  healthText.innerText = health;
  monsterHealthText.innerText = monsterHealth;
  if (health <= 0) {
    lose();
  } else if (monsterHealth <= 0) {
    if (fighting === 2) {
      winGame();
    } else {
      defeatMonster();
    }
  }
  if (Math.random() <= .1 && inventory.length !== 1) {
    text.innerText += " Your " + inventory.pop() + " breaks.";
    currentWeaponIndex--;
  }
}
```

## 158

- Now you can add a small easter egg (hidden feature) to your game.

Create a new function called easterEgg which calls the update function with locations[7] as the argument.

```html
function easterEgg() {
  update(locations[7]);
}
```

## 159

- Create an empty pick function with a parameter named guess.

```html
function pick(guess) {

}
```

## 160

- Create two new functions named pickTwo and pickEight.

Inside each of those, call the pick() function and pass either 2 or 8 as the argument depending on the function name.

```html
 function pickTwo() {
  pick(2);
}

function pickEight() {
  pick(8);
}
```

## 161

- Add another object to your locations array. Set name to "easter egg", set "button text" to an array with the strings "2", "8", and "Go to town square?", set "button functions" to an array with the variables pickTwo, pickEight, and goTown, and text to "You find a secret game. Pick a number above. Ten numbers will be randomly chosen between 0 and 10. If the number you choose matches one of the random numbers, you win!".

```html
{ 
    name: "easter egg", 
    "button text": ["2", "8", "Go to town square?"], 
    "button functions": [pickTwo, pickEight, goTown], 
    text: "You find a secret game. Pick a number above. Ten numbers will be randomly chosen between 0 and 10. If the number you choose matches one of the random numbers, you win!" 
  }
```

## 162

- Inside pick, use const to initialize a variable named numbers and set it to an empty array.

```html
function pick(guess) {
  const numbers = [];
}
```

## 163

- After your numbers array, create a while loop that runs as long as numbers.length is less than 10.

In the previous project, you learned how to work with while loops like this:

Example Code
while (condition) {
  // code to run
}

```html
function pick(guess) {
  const numbers = [];
  while(numbers.length < 10) {

  }
}
```

## 164

- Inside your while loop, push a random number between 0 and 10 to the end of the numbers array. You can create this random number with Math.floor(Math.random() * 11).

```html
function pick(guess) {
  const numbers = [];
  while (numbers.length < 10) {
    numbers.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 11));
  }
}
```

## 165

- After the while loop, set text.innerText to equal "You picked . Here are the random numbers:". Replace  with the guess function parameter.

```html
function pick(guess) {
  const numbers = [];
  while (numbers.length < 10) {
    numbers.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 11));
  }
  text.innerText = "You picked " + guess + ". Here are the random numbers:";
}
```

## 166

- At the end of the string, before the final quote, insert the new line escape character \n. This will cause the next part you add to text.innerText to appear on a new line.

```html
function pick(guess) {
  const numbers = [];
  while (numbers.length < 10) {
    numbers.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 11));
  }
  text.innerText = "You picked " + guess + ". Here are the random numbers:\n";
}
```

## 167

- In the previous project, you learned how to work with for loops like this:

Example Code
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  // code to run
}
for loops are declared with three expressions separated by semicolons: for (a; b; c), where a is the initialization expression, b is the condition, and c is the final expression.

In this step, create a for loop where i is initialized to 0, the loop runs as long as i is less than 10, and i is incremented by 1 after each iteration using the increment operator ++.

```html
function pick(guess) {
  const numbers = [];
  while (numbers.length < 10) {
    numbers.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 11));
  }
  text.innerText = "You picked " + guess + ". Here are the random numbers:\n";
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

  }
}
```

## 168

- Now you can write the logic to run in the loop. Inside your for loop, use the += operator to add to the end of text.innerText. Add the number at index i of the numbers array, using numbers[i]. Then add a new line, using the escape sequence you used earlier.

```html
function pick(guess) {
  const numbers = [];
  while (numbers.length < 10) {
    numbers.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 11));
  }
  text.innerText = "You picked " + guess + ". Here are the random numbers:\n";
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    text.innerText += numbers[i] + "\n";
  }
}
```

## 169

- The .includes() method determines if an array contains an element and will return either true or false.

Here is an example of the .includes() syntax:

Example Code
const numbersArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const number = 3

if (numbersArray.includes(number)) {
  console.log("The number is in the array.")
}
After your for loop, add an if statement to check if the guess is in the numbers array. You can use the .includes() method to check if the array contains the guess.

```html
function pick(guess) {
  const numbers = [];
  while (numbers.length < 10) {
    numbers.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 11));
  }
  text.innerText = "You picked " + guess + ". Here are the random numbers:\n";
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    text.innerText += numbers[i] + "\n";
    if (numbers.includes(guess)) {
    text.innerText += "Your guess is in the numbers array!"; // Indicate that the guess is found
  } else {
    text.innerText += "Your guess is not in the numbers array."; // Indicate that the guess is not found
  }
  }

}
```

## 170

- Inside the if statement, add the string "Right! You win 20 gold!" to the end of text.innerText. Also, add 20 to the value of gold and update the goldText.innerText.

```html
function pick(guess) {
  const numbers = [];
  while (numbers.length < 10) {
    numbers.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 11));
  }
  text.innerText = "You picked " + guess + ". Here are the random numbers:\n";
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    text.innerText += numbers[i] + "\n";
  }
  if (numbers.includes(guess)) {
     gold += 20; // Add 20 to the gold
    goldText.innerText = gold; // Update the gold display
    text.innerText += "Right! You win 20 gold!"; // Winning message
  }
}
```

## 171

- Now add an else statement. Inside, add "Wrong! You lose 10 health!" to the end of text.innerText. Subtract 10 from health and update healthText.innerText.

```html
function pick(guess) {
  const numbers = [];
  while (numbers.length < 10) {
    numbers.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 11));
  }
  text.innerText = "You picked " + guess + ". Here are the random numbers:\n";
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    text.innerText += numbers[i] + "\n";
  }
  if (numbers.includes(guess)) {
    text.innerText += "Right! You win 20 gold!";
    gold += 20;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
  }  else {
    health -= 10; // Subtract 10 from health
    healthText.innerText = health; // Update the health display
    text.innerText += "Wrong! You lose 10 health!"; // Losing message
  }
}
```

## 172

- Since you subtracted health from the player, you need to check if the player's health is less than or equal to 0. If it is, call the lose function.

```html
function pick(guess) {
  const numbers = [];
  while (numbers.length < 10) {
    numbers.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 11));
  }
  text.innerText = "You picked " + guess + ". Here are the random numbers:\n";
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    text.innerText += numbers[i] + "\n";
  }
  if (numbers.includes(guess)) {
    text.innerText += "Right! You win 20 gold!";
    gold += 20;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
  } else {
    text.innerText += "Wrong! You lose 10 health!";
    health -= 10;
    healthText.innerText = health;

     if (health <= 0) {
      lose(); // Call the lose function
    }
  }
}
```

## 173

- Looking at your "kill monster" object, "button functions" currently has three goTown variables. Replace the third one with easterEgg - this is how a player will access the hidden feature of the game. Do not change the "button text".

With this, your RPG game is complete! You can now play around - can you defeat the dragon?

```html
{
    name: "kill monster",
    "button text": ["Go to town square", "Go to town square", "Go to town square"],
    "button functions": [goTown, goTown, easterEgg],
    text: 'The monster screams "Arg!" as it dies. You gain experience points and find gold.'
  },
```
